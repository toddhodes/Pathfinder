background
----------

Reyleth was raised in Silverymoon in the Northwest of Faerun, east of Neverwinter and
Waterdeep, and Northeast from the Sword Coast

during the War of the Siler Marches under the Darkening / drow and orc invasion 1484-1485,
before the collapse of Luruar, Vecna was assisting the hordes.

my parents reportedly sold food to them, and remained what I felt was a suspect neutrality.
They have backtracked and claimed the put ground glass in the food they sold to evil forces,
but I doubt this story.

This led me to leave home and take up with the Knights in Silver of Silverymoon, training as
part of the Argent Legion.  Including a visit in the Everlund with the Army of the Vale.
And eventually, returning and moving to the Spellguard.

(Vecna also was attempting to intrude elsewhere in the multiverse, in a land
called Exandria, in the continent of Tal'Dorei, but was struck down and pushed seemingly back.)
