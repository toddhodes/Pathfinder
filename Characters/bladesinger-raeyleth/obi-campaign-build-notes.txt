background
----------

Raeyleth "Rey" Illia
(the elven script varies the spelling; Reylaeth or Raeylaeth or Reyleth are all appropriate and common)

Reyleth was raised in Silverymoon in the Northwest of Faerun, east of Neverwinter and
Waterdeep, and Northeast from the Sword Coast

During the War of the Silver Marches under the Darkening / drow and orc invasion 1484-1485,
before the collapse of Luruar, Vecna was assisting the hordes.

My parents reportedly sold food to both sides, and remained what I felt was a suspect neutrality.
They have backtracked and claimed they put ground glass in the food they sold to evil forces,
but I doubt this story.

This led me to leave home and take up with the Knights in Silver of Silverymoon, training as
part of the Argent Legion. Including a visit to Everlund with the Army of the Vale.
And eventually, returning and moving on to the Spellguard.

After achieving some success in battle spellcraft, I was educated in my later levels at the Lady's
College, the open school for mages in Silverymoon. It was here I became a follower of the principles
of High Lady Alustriel Silverhand, with the principles of democratic action in politics, and magic,
and war. Though I also know that politics and kindness are often naive given the arcane & divine forces
making human action sometimes seem ant-like.

During a seemingly routine combat in our city's lacklustre efforts to help Sundabar during the dying
days of the last wars, I recovered a fallen lieutenent's sword; unbeknownst to me, it was the legendary
Sword of Kas. In time, it led me unerringly to a general; from cover of greater invisibility I took a
swipe from behind, landing a glancing blow. The general was shocked -- affronted as much as hurt -- and
turned slowly. At that moment, I woke, as if from a stupor, at what I had done. I was staring straight
into a completely absurd sight; I had challenged Vecna himself.  The sword had driven me to this insane
act of bravery/stupidity. It's spell/curse/control momentarily broken, I hurled it away, and barely
teleported away with my life. I cannot imagine how I left that scene alive, in all honesty. Maybe Kas
or other god(s) had their eyes on me. Maybe Vecna was amused.

The months I spent with that sword deeply scarred me, but I avoid acknowledging it. (I don't deny
it, just keep it close.) It has soured me on the Gods, and those that entreat with them. I am not a
follower of religion, not a fan of the divine, or divine right, or the thoughtless, unprincipled,
"unintelligent" following of ancient faiths. I disapprove of ancient rulers holding themselves above
humanity.

And I don't pick up shiny talking swords anymore.
