# Back on the ship

as hours pass, a fog burns off.  the fog broke once you killed Selachai.  
the wind makes a light lapping sound on the ocean
the scent of the ocean passes over you
some welcome calm.

three-earings and the navigator sit at the wheel.

3 earings absent-mindedly removes her earings, one by one, then slowly pierces them in the other ear. 
replaces the other side with studs.

## Time on Board

- STAV: you've been rooting around in your kit, which you use to make items, mystical or practical, even sometimes using the parts on yourself.
        playing with your bracelets, the green material got you thinking.  rooting around in your core, you see it -- distinct trace amounts of
		green/turqoiuse elements incorporated into your constructions, one of which matches the green.  it could
		be mistaken for emerald, but not emerald.  wound around it it is a strage red gem element, also gemstone or
		crystal..  they're nothing anyone has seem before.  

        --> you can roll Investigation/History at the next place to ask questions

    DC 12 Investigation: 
        further investigatation proves red seems like it might be related to some kind of spell component, to empower spells.
        and the green seems to act as the channeling/control of it in your makeup.

- RYAN: a song has started to become an ear worm, finding its way into the songs you absent-mindly create while passing
        the time on the ship. a line about the crew reaching out for rope or cards.  
        it keeps creeping back into your mind, and you find yourself absent-mindedly reaching for your pendant.   
        its from somewhere you've definitely never been, but you're pretty used to that by now.  
        it's verses seem to be connecting you to something.  

- STEVEN: you've been hearing the tune and find yourself humming along, finishing the lines, finishing the chorus.  
        as if you're familiar with it, too.  as you hum, you are struck by a spark of connection to the mystical

- BOTH: verses with metaphors to the calamity, the gods. the war.  the losses.  the divine gate.
        verses about hair, hair spilling out, hair bound into rope.  the leading of armies.

- STEVEN:
       : what is your new spell?  
       as you do a test casting of it, it's magically enhanced, empowered.  from a new source.  
       a less familiar part of the prime diety pantheon chiming in.  you're not sure which -- 
       3 are know to be associated with long flowing hair.
	   the changebringer (Avandra), the moonweaver (Sehanine), the Arch Heart (Corellon)

- RYAN: you're hit with the sudden realization that your family,
        the dodecahedron around your neck, your REAL family...  has been trying to contact you.
        untold generations of work, a mission, a need to do something VERY important.  

        there's a plan, but it's been LOST, the connection broken.

        your mother was VERY important.  her kidnapping broke a very careful line of work, out of order.

        your letter isn't just a keepsake.  it's a clue to the path your family lost with the kidnapping.  
        you need to reconnect to the dead inside you a find it.  the words to the song are a piece, a word, a name, imagery.
        it's even connecting into the people around you.

        the Gods cannot pass through the Divine Gate. they can reach through it, and connect others.

- BOTH: 
       a crewmember passes by and comments.  the song is from a children's tale?  
       "beware Vespin Chloras, he reaches out to free himself from the left hand of Asmodeus..."

        --> you can roll Investigation/History at the next place to ask questions

    DC 12 Investigation/History: 
       the only lore that connects Vespin, Asmodeous, and the hair dieities is the Kiss of the Changebringer.
       Legend holds that Asmodeus stole this amulet from the neck of Avandra and locked it away within the vaults of
       Bazzoxan. In an expedition into the dark fortress's depths, the Kiss of the Changebringer was found and claimed
       by a group of Aurora Watch soldiers.  also connected are the Star Razor, and Blackrazor.


- JAMES: your visit to the ship was a little too simple.  you recognized and were recognized on the way out. 
         he let you set the fire, and leave.  you're fairly certain he was an associate of Benji Moore.  
         the crew and 3ear seem ... suspicious.

        --> you can Roll / follow up at any port, or anyone you want to ask about it

   DC 12 Investigation: 
        Jace has not been heard from.  nor Benji.



# Darktow Isle

https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Darktow_Isle

### Entering the Bay

- show map and image of darktow isle

3ear:
- "You don't go there unless you're looking for trouble, or unless you are the trouble."
- one rule to Darktow: do not double-cross

- as you approach, Dragon Turtle's head pops up, watches you briefly, before then heading off to some reefs

  "Unlike most of the tropical islands of the area, the main island of Darktow Isle resembles little more than huge
   jagged cliff faces raised multiple hundreds of feet from the waters of its coast.  Around the base of these cliffs is
   a string of tangled docks used by the many ships of The Revelry. Torch lights mark the interconnecting routes through
   the docks to the streets and buildings of the city that are built into the very cliff face itself."

  "you know it is ruled by Plank King Wyatt Maranoss from his seat at the Throne Roost."


### On the docks

- "if anyone wants to look the part, there's clothes shops in Sundry Square"
- "otherwise, let's get caught up with the riff-raff.  on to the Roost."

- JOSH: a childhood friend approachs from the docs.  a aquaintance of yours and Kirjava.  "Pan?"
        asks what you were doing 
           --> tragedy of the Palma Flora Festival, and the possibility of going to the Festival of Merit in Jigow.  
        tells you that there are others of your friends, orphans who survived the monster pit massacre, up north.
        look for them in Phandelin, among the Phandelvers.  one of them has an uncle up there.  Lionshield Coster.

	DC 12 Investigation/History: Phandalin is a mining town of humans and dwarves, an ex-pat mining colony of empire races.
          been there a while now, just north of jigow, in a rare patch of woods alongside a mountain range and the coast.


### Entering the Roost

describe scene:
  "The Plank King is a giant of a man. dull gray skin covered in scars and his eyes are cold even when smiling. While
   most goliath men do not have hair, Wyatt has long black curls that fall past the shoulders.  his
   charisma makes him welcoming, but scary."

- flanked on his right by a all-black tabaxi, with a sharp grey vest, and flowing grey pants, and grey bandoleers
- to his left a tortle in mottled blue-green shell holding a trident 
 and beside each of those a
  - a triton in long flowing black hair, and matching scimitars
  - a female sea elf w/ curly, shoulder-length blonde hair and a scar above one eye, waring a tattered black coat
  - a human scribe, and a human scribe/bard - Linus & Solon

otherwise humans and a mix of the other local races.

then they're greeted:

- the Plank King laughs out loud at your entry, startling two men beeseeching him and calls out,
  "Three Earings! You're back from the mainland! And you brought friends!" 
   he motions far to this left at somone, then looks to his right.
   The Tabaxi looks back and says, "how about i take this to the back room?"

the kings motions stares at all of you a second, then motions to the closer scribe, who whispers for a moment.  
"go ahead.... wait, just a second."  triton goes to james.

- JAMES: triton recognizes the pendant, asks about Jace and the Hammertow.  
        asks what side Jace is on these days.  haven't seen him around.
        recognizes pendant.  Squalls?  military family?
        says those triton sailors are suffering.
        lots of folks are on the lookout for...  aquatic artifacts.  (it could potentially counter the rod)


### Entering the side room

3 earings introduces you to the tabaxi 

3: "This is Tybalt, my dad."  Tybalt Rye - right hand to the Plank King, father of 3 earings.
T:
  - "we've heard about the devistation"
  - "did you bring any liquor for the king?"
  - "what's the status of the staff?"
3: 
  - "it was wilder than anyone could imagine.  the entire island sank into the sea like it was nothing.
  these brave adventurers, and friends, saved many lives, including multiple of my crew.  without them, who knows."
T: "is the spy still onboard?  
3: she nods, motions to bob and says, "was worried about this one, then he lit a concord ship on fire for us."
   "i think dajarkal signalled for them."
T: "how nice. looks like a pirate to me."  clearly meant it as a compliment.
   " ... anyway, so... about the rod?"

she motions to you to answer about the rod.
