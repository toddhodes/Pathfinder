## Heros 

 Alyxian’s Allies

 1. Phaelis - Champion of the Wildmother
  --> intro plot with him that will tie the Druid in
  
  Phaelis was a halfling Druid from the area of the current-day Lotusden Greenwood.
  With the Wildmother’s blessing, they created 3 artifacts together.
  
  - The Verdant Heart, a green pendant on a necklace. (roll on a d100 table to polymorph into
  random beast once per day)

  - Sapling, a staff made from a branch of the Seed of Rebirth in Vasselheim. (+1 Magic
  quarterstaff w/ +1 to spell attack rolls and the Tree Form ability from the Staff of the
  Woodlands)

  - The Hide of the Feral Guardian (Vestige of Divergence)

  When Phaelis fell in the Battle for Ghor Dranas, these three artifacts were scattered across
  Exandria. In memory of Phaelis and as a beacon of hope, the Wildmother later sprouted the
  Arbor Exemplar from the remains of his body.

 2. Orrik - Champion of the All-Hammer
  --> intro plot with him that will tie into Paladin

  Orrik was a dwarf Paladin who fell in the battle for Ghor Dranas. He wields a Vestige of
  Divergence which was forged in the Core Anvil. A hammer called Obsidias.

  Not much is known about Orrik, nor about Obsidias 

 3. Duana - Champion of the Dawnfather

  Duana was an elven high priestess (cleric) of the Dawnfather who fell in the Battle for Ghor
  Dranas. She was the original owner of the Plate of the Dawnmartyr, a Vestige of Divergence
  which now rests in the hands of Pike Trickfoot.

  (The only info on her official wiki is that she wore the vestige before Pike and died in the
  battle for Ghor Dranas, so this seemed like a perfect fit)

 4. Dyamak - Champion of the Knowing Mentor

  Dyamak was a blue Dragonborn monk who fell in the Battle for Ghor Dranas. She was the
  original owner of a Vestige of Divergence known as Dyamak’s Wraps.

  She is the original “Cobalt Soul” monk. As the champion of Ioun, she gathered knowledge and
  tried to stomp out corruption wherever possible. After her passing, the tenets she lived by
  became the basis for the Order of the Cobalt Soul, and the order was named in her honor.
  Though she has long since been forgotten even to those within the order, her spirit lives on
  through them.

  When these heroes died, Alyxian called upon the Moonweaver and was granted an ally in
  Perigee, but we all know about her.
