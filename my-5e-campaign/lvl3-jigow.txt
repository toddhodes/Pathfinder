## Prepare for Jigow

[re-read thealexandrian.net remixing-call-of-the-netherdeep-part-2-jigow]

 "Jigow is located in northern Xhorhas on the banks of the Emerald Gulch and the Ifolon River. An
  amalgamation of coastal villages that were originally settled by several nomadic clans of orcs
  and goblins, the city gained a significant drow population after Jigow became a part of the Kryn
  Dynasty.

 "The villages and townships that make up Jigow are loosely divided into three major areas: the
  Meatwaters, the main dock area on the shores of the Ifolon River; the Wetwalks, a collection of
  houses on stilts closest to the wetlands and marshes; and the Jumble, the most densely populated
  region of the city, where houses are built among giant mangrove trees or on the backs of
  horizonback tortoises and used as traveling homes.

 "Jigow has a council of elders and a military presence in the form of the Aurora Watch—soldiers
  of the Kryn Dynasty.  The dynasty also has a political liaison in Jigow: a drow named Durth
  Mirimm (see area J9) reporting to the court of the Bright Queen

 "Ayo has left ahead of you to set up the palma flora stand

# Arrive Jigow

 "You have entered the Jumble, a large district of tangled roads and single-story buildings in
  the town of Jigow. Throngs of people, most of them orcs and goblins, seconded by kobolds,
  bugbears, hobgoblins, and all manner of bizaare creatures move through the streets, laughing,
  singing, and sightseeing.  All are enthralled by the raucous sights and sounds of the town's
  Festival of Merit which is underway.

  You hear snippets of conversations as people pass by: a goblin mother telling her children not
  to go near the baby horizonback tortoises, a drow guard in shining insectile armor complaining
  to his partner that his gauntlet was crushed by a hulking orc while arm-wrestling, and a pair of
  young orcs in swimwear hollering as they rush toward the banks of the Ifolon River.  All around
  you, colorful signs and banners point toward festival booths and busy throughfairs.  On this
  street alone, you can see a meat-pie eating contest near a shop mounted on the back of a massive
  tortoise [J1], and on the other side of the road, a banner emblazoned with the words “Riddles
  and Rhymes: Take Your Shot!” That banner points toward a three-story temple in the center of the
  Jumble. [J7] Ahead is a registration/information table with a trio of orcs calmly manning it.


## Character status

- Ryan: sounds of the festival resonate with your half-orc upbringing.
     there is a joyousness around the culture you are not accustomed to.
- Josh: you are keeping an eye out for ex-pats, no hits yet
- Stephen: you keep seeing fleeting glimpes of a long-haired human in your perephial vision among the crowds.
   but when you turn to focus, there's is nothing there.
- James: no news of Jace. no signs from the Rod or Retribution
- Stav: you're now near the city of Bazzoxan -- a dark military encampment that keeps watch over the Betrayers' Rise,
   a key instrumental to the Betrayer Gods during the Calamity.  No one has a clue what the red jewel material is, but it reminds
   them of the incredibley rare element ruidium, named after the red moon.
   ruidium is local only to the moumentially scarred areas of the final terrible battles of the calamity,
   in an area to your SE across the Barbed Fields.

Landmarks:
- J8: Temple of the Luxon

 Dermot explains Luxon.

   The Luxon is a divine entity of light and rebirth that grants its faithful "esoteric" secrets.

   Dying within range of a Luxon Beacon allows for our soul to be reincarnated within a newborn also within range of the beacon.

   The process of preparing one's soul for rebirth is called Consecution.

   Through the process of Consecution we live many lifetimes, in bodies different from the ones
   they were first born in, and with families the grow in strange and mytical ways.

   Irvin here lived a previous life as a bugbear of Den Hythenos.

   I was a drow, reborn a bullywug, reborn a deep gnome, reborn a Githyanki, and now a goblin.

   On each step, as we grow through consecuted rebirth, we gain greater knowledge about the world, and hidden 
   secrets. multi-life generational goals.  Maybe even some shared divine purpose of peace or resolution.

   followers of the path can lose their connection to the glow of the luxon.  but when the path of
   their past lives and families is truly powerful, they can to be drawn back in mysterious ways.

   i think you might be such a person, Rumblebottom Loudpants. (he jokes) "Rumblepants Loudbottom."

## Final Exercises

 "the sound of rhythmic drumming echoes throughout the Jumble.
  People explain they are summoning the participants to the paddock (J6), cleared of horizonbacks
  A council of elders collects on the podium, a mix of orcs and goblins, 12 total, one/village
  After a series of speeches and various congrats to each other, an elderly orc dressed in deep blue robes stands 
  atop a platform of crates. He smiles at the crowd. "Mighty warriors, brilliant strategists, you
  have impressed us with your feats of strength, wit, resolve, and consitution." 
  "And now for the final event. Two teams will be chosen to compete in a race through the depths of the Emerald Grotto, 
  and a great prize awaits the victor! - a replica of the Emerald Eye (100gp)"  
  The elders and their priests begin a series of augury spells, and, chattering.  People sip their drinks and gaze around
  at the assembled masses.  Finally, the elder turns
  "our first selection is: Ajo Jabe.  come get your badge, and ready yourself to choose a team."
  "our second selection: our new frinds who beat every single challenge, ran off miscreants to boot:  
   Rumble and his friends.  come get your badge."

  drinks are put in your hands, and laurels around your heads.
  and with that, you're on your way to the grotto, surrounded by well-wishers and merriment.

# Emerald Grotto


  Elder Ushru stands before the mouth of a cave and addresses you and your opponents. "You brave
  and valiant individuals have triumphed in many challenges this day; now, the final Test of Merit
  awaits you!" He pulls a palm-sized gold-and-emerald amulet from his robes, holds it aloft, and
  declares: "This medal, the Emerald Eye, has a twin has been placed in the deepest cavern of the Emerald Grotto. Be the
  first to wear it and you will be declared Jigow's Champions of Merit. A title to cherish for the ages."

  Ajo, do you have a name for your team, for the commentators ease?  "The Others"

## E12: Prayer Site of Sehanine

  The light around the pedestal fades as a spectral figure in the form of a male human rises
  from the amulet. He is dressed in leather armor and a tattered red cape and wears a shield.
  His face is framed by curly brown hair and bears a melancholic expression. 

  Suddenly, the ground vanishes beneath your feet, and you fall, tumbling through a vortex of
  golden light. You fall deeper, deeper, deeper, then suddenly stop. The golden light subsides,
  and you find yourself suspended in a pitch-black expanse. You feel water buoying you. A
  vermilion light appears in the distance, illuminating the melancholy warrior, who is shackled
  to the ground by crimson crystal chains.

  He raises his gaze and chokes out a surprise.

  "Oh! Thank the gods. Someone! [amazement]
   How are you even...  [quizically]
   I'm *Alyxian*, but I've been lost for an eternity, lost in this... darkness." [waves around]

   His eyes cast around, but you cannpt tell what he sees.
   As the pressure of the water crushes you, you feel consciousness leaving.

  "No, no, no, you're already fading," [panics]

  "Long ago, my troops and I prayed in the heart of battle.
   These moments turned the tide."

  "Please.  I beg you... Go to the shrines where we prayed, and the gods answered."
   Use the jewel and...  Get the Jewel to the Cyst of Avandra."

   He looks to you with desperate eyes.  and is gone.


 --> Researching the jewel

     See next level [within Betrayer’s Rise beneath Bazzoxan]


### Revelation List: Campaign Agendas

What is the Jewel of Three Prayers? Specifically, the PCs should be able to figure out
that it was empowered by the gods to aid Alyxian three times; that shrines were erected
in those places; and that they need to find the shrines in order to fully reactivate the
Jewel.

What is ruidium and what should be done with it? This obviously includes the properties
of ruidium itself, but it should also become clear that ruidium is appearing at sites
associated with the Apotheon.

Who is Alyxian the Apotheon? Answering this means piecing together the details of his
story and framing the ultimate question of the campaign, which is whether he should be
helped, freed, or destroyed. (You may also discover that understanding what’s at stake
if the Apotheon is freed is an important and distinct revelation.)
