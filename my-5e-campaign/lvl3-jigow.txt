# Emerald Grotto

## setup

- tracking table
- ask them for a team name; choose a rivals name "the others"
- mural

Place where Alyxian prayed to Sehanine the Moonweaver

E1 (Grotto Entrance): murals of Sehanine (a white-haired girl no more than twelve
years old) with those who served her before the Calamity such as Perigee the Deva.

Murals are aged and Perigee should be the least worn away of the Moonweaver's devas.

Add broken statues of devas throughout the grotto; an investigation of one will reveal
Perigee's name while all others are too worn away.

Religion or history to reveal that Perigee was one of the fighters at the Battle of the
Barbed Fields.

# Researching the jewel

You discover:
- that there’s a painting on the wall of Betrayers’ Rise which depicts the Jewel.
  "I was in Bazzoxan once, where the legacy of the Calamity lingers more strongly
   anywhere else in Xhorhas, and I saw this very Jewel depicted on the walls of the
   Betrayers’ Rise.  Perhaps you will find answers there."

- a journal of one of the explorers who delved too deep and awakened the abyssal gate in
  Bazzoxan. The end of the journal trails off into mad gibberings, but it includes a
  vivid description of a figure that resembles the one you saw in your vision.

- leading experts on this from Ank’harel.  Recent reports suggest that they’re on a
  field assignment in Bazzoxan.

## Moons

when/how??
- ruidium exists in tiny amounts
- moons phases
- red moon is weird


## Revelation List: Campaign Agendas

What is the Jewel of Three Prayers? Specifically, the PCs should be able to figure out
that it was empowered by the gods to aid Alyxian three times; that shrines were erected
in those places; and that they need to find the shrines in order to fully reactivate the
Jewel.

What is ruidium and what should be done with it? This obviously includes the properties
of ruidium itself, but it should also become clear that ruidium is appearing at sites
associated with the Apotheon.

Who is Alyxian the Apotheon? Answering this means piecing together the details of his
story and framing the ultimate question of the campaign, which is whether he should be
helped, freed, or destroyed. (You may also discover that understanding what’s at stake
if the Apotheon is freed is an important and distinct revelation.)
