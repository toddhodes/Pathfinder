### Leave for Jigow

[re-read thealexandrian.net remixing-call-of-the-netherdeep-part-2-jigow]

 "Jigow is located in northern Xhorhas on the banks of the Emerald Gulch and the Ifolon River. An
  amalgamation of coastal villages that were originally settled by several nomadic clans of orcs
  and goblins, the city gained a significant drow population after Jigow became a part of the Kryn
  Dynasty.

 "The villages and townships that make up Jigow are loosely divided into three major areas: the
  Meatwaters, the main dock area on the shores of the Ifolon River; the Wetwalks, a collection of
  houses on stilts closest to the wetlands and marshes; and the Jumble, the most densely populated
  region of the city, where houses are built among giant mangrove trees or on the backs of
  horizonback tortoises and used as traveling homes.

 "Jigow has a council of elders and a military presence in the form of the Aurora Watch—soldiers
  of the Kryn Dynasty.  The dynasty also has a political liaison in Jigow: a drow named Durth
  Mirimm (see area J9) reporting to the court of the Bright Queen


### character status

Ayo has left ahead of you to set up the palma flora stand

- Ryan: sounds of the festival resonate with your half-orc upbringing.  
     there is a joyousness around the culture you are not accustomed to.
- Josh: you are keeping an eye out for ex-pats, no hits yet
- Stephen: you keep seeing fleeting glimpes of a long-haired human in your perephial vision.
   but when you turn to focus, there's is nothing there.  it's getting odd.
- James: no news of Jace and no signs from the Rod or Retribution
- Stav: you're now very near the city of Bazzoxan -- a dark military encampment that keeps watch over the Betrayers' Rise, 
   a key instrumental to the Betrayer Gods during the Calamity.  No one has a clue what the red jewel material is, but it reminds
   them of ruidium, which is named after the red moon.  ruidium is local only to these moumentially scarred areas to your SE


# Arrive Jigow

 "You have entered the Jumble, a large district of tangled roads and single-story buildings in
  the town of Jigow. Throngs of people, most of them orcs and goblins, seconded by kobolds,
  bugbears, hobgoblins, and all manner of bizaare creatures move through the streets, laughing,
  singing, and sightseeing.  All are enthralled by the raucous sights and sounds of the town's
  Festival of Merit which is underway.  

  You hear snippets of conversations as people pass by: a goblin mother telling her children not
  to go near the baby horizonback tortoises, a drow guard in shining insectile armor complaining
  to his partner that his gauntlet was crushed by a hulking orc while arm-wrestling, and a pair of
  young orcs in swimwear hollering as they rush toward the banks of the Ifolon River.  All around
  you, colorful signs and banners point toward festival booths and busy throughfairs.  On this
  street alone, you can see a meat-pie eating contest near a shop mounted on the back of a massive
  tortoise [J1], and on the other side of the road, a banner emblazoned with the words “Riddles
  and Rhymes: Take Your Shot!” That banner points toward a three-story temple in the center of the
  Jumble. [J7] Ahead is a registration/information table with a trio of orcs calmly manning it.

# Researching the jewel

You discover:
- that there’s a painting on the wall of Betrayers’ Rise which depicts the Jewel.
  "I was in Bazzoxan once, where the legacy of the Calamity lingers more strongly
   anywhere else in Xhorhas, and I saw this very Jewel depicted on the walls of the
   Betrayers’ Rise.  Perhaps you will find answers there."

- a journal of one of the explorers who delved too deep and awakened the abyssal gate in
  Bazzoxan. The end of the journal trails off into mad gibberings, but it includes a
  vivid description of a figure that resembles the one you saw in your vision.

- leading experts on this from Ank’harel.  Recent reports suggest that they’re on a
  field assignment in Bazzoxan.

## Moons

when/how??
- ruidium exists in tiny amounts
- moons phases
- red moon is weird


## Revelation List: Campaign Agendas

What is the Jewel of Three Prayers? Specifically, the PCs should be able to figure out
that it was empowered by the gods to aid Alyxian three times; that shrines were erected
in those places; and that they need to find the shrines in order to fully reactivate the
Jewel.

What is ruidium and what should be done with it? This obviously includes the properties
of ruidium itself, but it should also become clear that ruidium is appearing at sites
associated with the Apotheon.

Who is Alyxian the Apotheon? Answering this means piecing together the details of his
story and framing the ultimate question of the campaign, which is whether he should be
helped, freed, or destroyed. (You may also discover that understanding what’s at stake
if the Apotheon is freed is an important and distinct revelation.)


## Conclusions

re-mention two other hooks
