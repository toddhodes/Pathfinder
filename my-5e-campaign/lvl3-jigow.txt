# Back on the ship

as hours pass, a fog lifts, burns off. past two days is a blur.  you barely remember Port Damali.  the fog broke once you killed Selachai.  

- JAMES: your visit to the ship was a little too simple.  you recognized and were recognized on the way out. 
         he let you set the fire, and leave.  you're fairly certain he was an associate of Benji Moore.  
         the crew and 3ear seem ... suspicious.

        --> you can Roll / follow up at any port, or anyone you want to ask about it

   DC 12 Investigation: 
        Jace has not been heard from.  nor Benji.

- STAV: you've been rooting around in your kit, which you use to make items, mystical or practical, even sometimes using the parts on yourself.
        playing with your bracelets, the green material got you thinking.  rooting around in your core, you see it -- distinct trace amounts of
		green/turqoiuse elements incorporated into your constructions, one of which matches the green.  it could
		be mistaken for emerald, but not emerald.  wound around it it is a strage red gem element, also gemstone or
		crystal..  they're nothing anyone has seem before.  

        --> you can roll Investigation/History at the next place to ask questions

    DC 12 Investigation: 
        further investigatation proves red seems like it might be related to some kind of spell component, to empower spells.
        and the green seems to act as the channeling/control of it in your makeup.

- RYAN: a song has started to become an ear worm, finding its way into the songs you absent-mindly create while passing
        the time on the ship. a line about the crew reaching out for rope or cards.  
        it keeps creeping back into your mind, and you find yourself absent-mindedly reaching for your pendant.   
        its from somewhere you've definitely never been, but you're pretty used to that by now.  
        it's verses seem to be connecting you to something.  

- STEVEN: you've been hearing the tune and find yourself humming along, finishing the lines, finishing the chorus.  
        as if you're familiar with it, too.  as you hum, you are struck by a spark of connection to the mystical

- BOTH: verses with metaphors to the calamity, the gods. the war.  the losses.  the divine gate.
        verses about hair, hair spilling out, hair bound into rope.  the leading of armies.

- STEVEN:
       : what is your new spell?  
       as you do a test casting of it, it's magically enhanced, empowered.  from a new source.  
       a less familiar part of the prime diety pantheon chiming in.  you're not sure which -- 
       3 are know to be associated with long flowing hair.
	   the changebringer (Avandra), the moonweaver (Sehanine), the Arch Heart (Corellon)

- RYAN: you're hit with the sudden realization that your family,
        the dodecahedron around your neck, your REAL family...  has been trying to contact you.
        untold generations of work, a mission, a need to do something VERY important.  

        there's a plan, but it's been LOST,  the connection broken.

        your mother was VERY important.  her kidnapping broke a very careful line of work, out of order.

        your letter isn't just a keepsake.  it's a clue to the path your family lost with the kidnapping.  
        you need to reconnect to the dead inside you a find it.  the words to the song are a piece, a word, a name, imagery.
        it's even connecting into the people around you.

        the Gods cannot pass through the Divine Gate. they can reach through it, and connect others.

- BOTH: 
       a crewmember passes by and comments.  the song is from a children's tale?  
       "beware Vespin Chloras, he reaches out to free himself from the left hand of Asmodeus..."

        --> you can roll Investigation/History at the next place to ask questions

    DC 12 Investigation/History: 
       the only lore that connects Vespin, Asmodeous, and the hair dieities is the Kiss of the Changebringer.
       Legend holds that Asmodeus stole this amulet from the neck of Avandra and locked it away within the vaults of
       Bazzoxan. In an expedition into the dark fortress's depths, the Kiss of the Changebringer was found and claimed
       by a group of Aurora Watch soldiers.  also connected are the Star Razor, and Blackrazor.


three-earings and the navigator sit at the wheel.

the sun breaks.  and the red moon rises behind it, a bit below the larger white moon.

the wind makes a light lapping sound on the ocean

the waft of palma flower scent passes over you

3 earings absent-mindedly removed her earings, one by one.  and then slowly pierces them, one by one, in the other ear. replacing the 
other side with studs.  "three, you ok?"  "yea, it just feels... time for a change."


## Decisions on rod

btw - would you like to give the rod of retribution a name?

she mentions she's happy to take you to the dynasty by ship, if you like.  

but before that, recommends you talk to her father and the plank king

# Darktow Isle

https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Darktow_Isle

### Entering the Bay

- show map of darktow isle
- as you approach, Dragon Turtle's head pops up, watches you briefly, before then heading off to some reefs

  "Unlike most of the tropical islands of the area, the main island of Darktow Isle resembles little more than huge
   jagged cliff faces raised multiple hundreds of feet from the waters of its coast.  Around the base of these cliffs is
   a string of tangled docks used by the many ships of The Revelry. Torch lights mark the interconnecting routes through
   the docks to the streets and buildings of the city that are built into the very cliff face itself."

  "It is ruled by Plank King Wyatt Maranoss from the Throne Roost."


- one rule to Darktow: do not double-cross.  single sanction: appear before the Plank King for immediate judgement
3ear:
- "You don't here ere unless you're looking for trouble, or unless you are the trouble."

show entry images
- "if anyone wants to look the part, there's clothes shops in Sundry Square"
- "otherwise, let's get caught up with the riff-raff.  on to the Roost."


### On the docks

- JOSH: a childhood friend approached in the city.  a friend of yours and Kirjava.  he calls you Pan.  
        asks what you were doing 
           --> tragedy of the Palma Flora Festival, and the possibility of going to the Festival of Merit in Jigow.  
        tells you that there are others of your friends, orphans who survived the monster pit massacre, up north.
        look for them in Phandelin, among the Phandelvers.  one of them has an uncle up there.  Lionshield Coster.

	DC 12 Investigation/History: Phandalin is a mining town of humans and dwarves, an ex-pat mining colony of empire races.
          been there a while now, just north of jigow, in a rare patch of woods alongside a mountain range and the coast.


### Entering the Roost

describe scene:
  "The Plank King is a giant of a man. dull gray skin covered in scars and his eyes are cold even when smiling. While
   most goliath men do not have hair, Wyatt has long black curls that fall past the shoulders.  his
   charisma makes him welcoming, but scary."

- flanked on his right by a all-black tabaxi, with a sharp grey vest, and flowing grey pants, and grey bandoleers
- to his left a tortle in mottled blue-green shell holding a trident 
and beside each of those a
  - a pair of twin tritons, in long flowing black hair, and matching scimitars
  - a female sea elf w/ curly, shoulder-length blonde hair and a scar above one eye, waring a tattered black coat
  - a human scribe, and a human scribe/bard - Linus & Solon

otherwise humans and a mix of the other local races.

then they're greeted:

- the Plank King laughs out loud at your entry, startling two men beeseeching him and calls out,
  "Three Earings! You're back from the mainland! And you brought friends!" 
   he motions far to this left at somone, then looks to his right.
   The Tabaxi looks back and says, "how about i take this to the back room?"

the kings motions stares at all of you a second, then motions to the closer scribe, who whispers for a moment.  
"go ahead.... wait, just a second."  triton goes to james.

- JAMES: triton recognizes the name, asks about Jace and the Hammertow.  and wait... you're dad is... Squalls?  military family?
        recognizes pendant. says sailors are suffering and only Wave can save them.
        you recognize that there is a potential vestige called "Wave" connected to the Tritons. it could potentially counter the rod.

### Entering the side room

3 earings introduces you to the tabaxi 

3: "This is Tybalt, my dad."  Tybalt Rye - right hand to the Plank King, father of 3 earings.
T:
  - "we've heard about the devistation"
  - "did you bring any liquor for the king?"
  - "what's the status of the staff?"
3: 
  - "it was wilder than anyone could imagine.  the entire island sank into the sea like it was nothing.
  these brave adventurers, and friends, saved many lives, including multiple of my crew.  without them, who knows."
T: "is the spy still onboard?  
3: she nods, motions to bob and says, "was worried about this one, then he lit a concord ship on fire for us."
   "i think dajarkal signalled for them."
T: "how nice. looks like a pirate to me."  clearly meant it as a compliment.
   " ... anyway, so... about the rod?"

she motions to you to answer about the rod.

the Plank King / Tybalt provides sending stones http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:sending-stones
"whereever the rod goes, one of these does too"
"whereever you go, one of these does too"

# Arrive Jigow

[re-read thealexandrian.net remixing-call-of-the-netherdeep-part-2-jigow]

Jigow is located in northern Xhorhas on the banks of the Emerald Gulch and the Ifolon River. An
amalgamation of coastal villages that were originally settled by several nomadic clans of orcs
and goblins, Jigow is now home to humans and other folk as well, and the city gained a
significant drow population after Jigow became a part of the Kryn Dynasty.  You visited one of
these human outgrowths in Phandalen.

The villages and townships that make up Jigow are loosely divided into three major areas: the
Meatwaters, the main dock area on the shores of the Ifolon River; the Wetwalks, a collection of
houses on stilts closest to the wetlands and marshes; and the Jumble, the most densely
populated region of the city, where houses are built among giant mangrove trees or on the backs
of horizonback tortoises and used as traveling homes.

Jigow has a council of elders and a military presence in the form of the Aurora Watch—soldiers
of the Kryn Dynasty.  The dynasty also has a political liaison in Jigow: a drow named Durth
Mirimm (see area J9) reporting to the court of the Bright Queen

choose a district:
Meatwaters: J2, J3      maze, plunge
Jumble:     J1, J4, J7  pie, armwrestle, riddles
Wetwalk:    J5, J6      rice, herding

# Emerald Grotto

## setup

- tracking table
- ask them for a team name; choose a rivals name "the others"
- mural


E1 (Grotto Entrance): aged murals of Sehanine (a white-haired girl no more than twelve
years old) with those who served her before the Calamity. describe 3 - no names.

E3 - 3 broken statues of <>.  seems there are broken statues of devas throughout the grotto

DC 15 investigation - reveal Perigee's name 
DC 15 Religion/history - reveal that Perigee was one of the fighters at the Battle of the Barbed Fields.

- moonshark++: https://i.redd.it/f63nanntpt591.jpg
- do not mention, future knowldege: Place where Alyxian prayed to Sehanine the Moonweaver


# Researching the jewel

You discover:
- that there’s a painting on the wall of Betrayers’ Rise which depicts the Jewel.
  "I was in Bazzoxan once, where the legacy of the Calamity lingers more strongly
   anywhere else in Xhorhas, and I saw this very Jewel depicted on the walls of the
   Betrayers’ Rise.  Perhaps you will find answers there."

- a journal of one of the explorers who delved too deep and awakened the abyssal gate in
  Bazzoxan. The end of the journal trails off into mad gibberings, but it includes a
  vivid description of a figure that resembles the one you saw in your vision.

- leading experts on this from Ank’harel.  Recent reports suggest that they’re on a
  field assignment in Bazzoxan.

## Moons

when/how??
- ruidium exists in tiny amounts
- moons phases
- red moon is weird


## Revelation List: Campaign Agendas

What is the Jewel of Three Prayers? Specifically, the PCs should be able to figure out
that it was empowered by the gods to aid Alyxian three times; that shrines were erected
in those places; and that they need to find the shrines in order to fully reactivate the
Jewel.

What is ruidium and what should be done with it? This obviously includes the properties
of ruidium itself, but it should also become clear that ruidium is appearing at sites
associated with the Apotheon.

Who is Alyxian the Apotheon? Answering this means piecing together the details of his
story and framing the ultimate question of the campaign, which is whether he should be
helped, freed, or destroyed. (You may also discover that understanding what’s at stake
if the Apotheon is freed is an important and distinct revelation.)

## Revelation List: Lore of Alyxian

- History of the Jewel of Three Prayers.
- The Jewel of Three Prayers was empowered by the gods three times.
- Shrines were erected near each location where the Jewel was empowered.
- The Jewel can be fully reactivated by visiting the shrines.
- Ruidium is appearing in sites associated with the Apotheon.
- Properties of ruidium.
