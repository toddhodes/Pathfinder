# Arrive Jigow

[re-read thealexandrian.net remixing-call-of-the-netherdeep-part-2-jigow]

Jigow is located in northern Xhorhas on the banks of the Emerald Gulch and the Ifolon River. An
amalgamation of coastal villages that were originally settled by several nomadic clans of orcs
and goblins, Jigow is now home to humans and other folk as well, and the city gained a
significant drow population after Jigow became a part of the Kryn Dynasty.  You visited one of
these human outgrowths in Phandalen.

The villages and townships that make up Jigow are loosely divided into three major areas: the
Meatwaters, the main dock area on the shores of the Ifolon River; the Wetwalks, a collection of
houses on stilts closest to the wetlands and marshes; and the Jumble, the most densely
populated region of the city, where houses are built among giant mangrove trees or on the backs
of horizonback tortoises and used as traveling homes.

Jigow has a council of elders and a military presence in the form of the Aurora Watch—soldiers
of the Kryn Dynasty.  The dynasty also has a political liaison in Jigow: a drow named Durth
Mirimm (see area J9) reporting to the court of the Bright Queen

choose a district:
Meatwaters: J2, J3      maze, plunge
Jumble:     J1, J4, J7  pie, armwrestle, riddles
Wetwalk:    J5, J6      rice, herding

- do not mention, future knowldege: Place where Alyxian prayed to Sehanine the Moonweaver


# Researching the jewel

You discover:
- that there’s a painting on the wall of Betrayers’ Rise which depicts the Jewel.
  "I was in Bazzoxan once, where the legacy of the Calamity lingers more strongly
   anywhere else in Xhorhas, and I saw this very Jewel depicted on the walls of the
   Betrayers’ Rise.  Perhaps you will find answers there."

- a journal of one of the explorers who delved too deep and awakened the abyssal gate in
  Bazzoxan. The end of the journal trails off into mad gibberings, but it includes a
  vivid description of a figure that resembles the one you saw in your vision.

- leading experts on this from Ank’harel.  Recent reports suggest that they’re on a
  field assignment in Bazzoxan.

## Moons

when/how??
- ruidium exists in tiny amounts
- moons phases
- red moon is weird


## Revelation List: Campaign Agendas

What is the Jewel of Three Prayers? Specifically, the PCs should be able to figure out
that it was empowered by the gods to aid Alyxian three times; that shrines were erected
in those places; and that they need to find the shrines in order to fully reactivate the
Jewel.

What is ruidium and what should be done with it? This obviously includes the properties
of ruidium itself, but it should also become clear that ruidium is appearing at sites
associated with the Apotheon.

Who is Alyxian the Apotheon? Answering this means piecing together the details of his
story and framing the ultimate question of the campaign, which is whether he should be
helped, freed, or destroyed. (You may also discover that understanding what’s at stake
if the Apotheon is freed is an important and distinct revelation.)

## Revelation List: Lore of Alyxian

- History of the Jewel of Three Prayers.
- The Jewel of Three Prayers was empowered by the gods three times.
- Shrines were erected near each location where the Jewel was empowered.
- The Jewel can be fully reactivated by visiting the shrines.
- Ruidium is appearing in sites associated with the Apotheon.
- Properties of ruidium.
- The Lore of the Alyxian
