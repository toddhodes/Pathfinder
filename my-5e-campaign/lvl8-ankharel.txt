   The archmage Keraptis has the Lute of the Beacon at White Plume Mountain.  a person of the right lineage can
   play the lute and re-discover the song of the lute of the beacon, whose lyrics could provide the first clues of
   that lineage's generational goals.

   in the heart of the Floktet Alps. lies Kravaarad. a among these chilled mountains of chaos magice lies a 
   miniature companion to Kravaarad: White Plume Mountain. a haven for the wizard Keraptis.

# Setup entry

Remind players of Ank’harel main factions:

   - the Library of the Cobalt Soul
     researcher: Question (Library)
     agenda: the Library wants it destroyed
      believe that ruidium is dangerous and it must be either destroyed or sealed away so that it cannot harm the world.

   — the Allegiance of Allsight
     researcher: Prolix Yusaf (Allegiance)
     agenda: The Allegiance wants to use it to become arms dealers
      want to use the ruidium to create weapons, armor, and other artifacts that they can sell to the highest bidder.

   - the Consortium of Vermilion Dreams
     researcher: Aloysia Telfin (Consortium)
     agenda: the Consortium wants to monopolize it for arcane research
      want to secure a monopoly on ruidium so that they can study its deeper mysteries and have sole access to its power.

Of your three contacts:
- Question has probably gone back to report on the missing expedition party you resovled, and what happened in Betrayer’s Rise.
  had made plans with Prolix Yusaf to return to Ank'Harel together if the Library of the Cobalt Soul's expedition was lost.
- Prolix offered to introduce the characters to his peers in the Allegiance of Allsight
- Aloysia offered similar with the Consortium of Vermilion Dreams
- also, in you absense, another group has been hired by Taskhand Verin Thelyss

# Entry

   --> [share map and image]

 "The gloom of Bazzoxan and cold of the Greying Wildlands gives way to the sunlight and warm winds of Marquet
  as you arrive in the metropolis of Ank'Harel.

  You find yourself in a realm of sprawling roads and towering structures humming with life, all surrounded by the golden dunes of the Marquesian desert.
  The spectacular desert metropolis of Ank'Harel is the most precious jewel on the continent of Marquet.

  Located thousands of miles from Wildemount, Ank'Harel is vibrant and alive, a sharp contrast to the war-scarred lands or chaotic cold you have left behind.

  Ank'Harel translates to "Jewel of Hope" in the northern dialect of the Marquesian language.  The city was established as an
  oasis trading post. A rare source of underground fresh water made this one of the few habitable locations in the vast desert.
  As more travelers arrived to take part in building this metropolis, unpaved roads were upgraded to stone streets, and walls were
  bolstered with towers and parapets. Ank'Harel flourished, becoming a cultural melting pot of people from across the continent
  and some from farther away.

## Districts

The city is divided into eight districts: 

- the Alluvium District, 
    Named for the rich clay mined in the cliffs that border it, a mixture of dense residential sections, sites of 
    clay strip mining, and spacious plazas used for oral performances and artisan markets.
- the Circlet Walk, 
    primarily a residential district, plus taverns and other places of commerce as well. 
    so packed with buildings it's customary for people to travel by hopping from rooftop to rooftop rather than navigating the narrow roads.
- the Guided District, 
    contains most houses of worship, each Prime Deities represented. architecture is ornamental; 
    temples are adorned with intricate mosaics and crowned by minarets with gilded spires.
- the Ridge, 
    Sitting atop one of the city's three plateaus, the Ridge is Ank'Harel's industrial district. 
    crowded with smithies, foundries, shipyards, and warehouses.
- the River District, 
    permeated by the smell of wet earth, strips of irrigated cropland are intermingled with hydroponic farms, 
    in place of roads, canals connect the subdivisions of the district. traverse in skiffs and canoes.
- the Sand-Herald District, 
    seat of government, center of military and law enforcement, HQ of the Hands of Ord.  site of Ank'Harel's skyport.
    The HoO's stronghold is a major feature, dwarfed only by the *Cerulean Palace*'s purple and blue spires 
    residences are mostly wealthy: powerful merchants, decorated mercenaries, celebrities of song and stage. 
    [only other skyports: Port Damali in Wildemount, Vasselheim in Issylra, Emon and Whitestone in Tal'Dorei]
- the Sigil District, 
    smaller but busy, people from across the city commute to study at the district's various centers of learning. 
    buildings representing cultures from across Exandria are a counterpoint to the grand, Marquesian-style domes of the Crystal Chateau. 
- the Suncut Bazaar,
    center of commerce in Ank'Harel.  the palatial Luck's Run casino.
    densely-packed stone buildings w/ stores, artisan goods, and magic shops, trinkets. 
    Crimson banners, hanging flags, cloth drapery provide shade.  Awnings stretch above open-air food stalls; fresh fruit, sweet semolina cakes, roasting spits.

Consortium beholder leader
https://www.reddit.com/r/CalloftheNetherdeep/comments/17b1u17/this_is_how_i_made_the_consortium_a_memorable/

## Allegiance of Allsight

Generally, the Allegiance of Allsight are focused on their reseach of Cael Morrow, and later,
securing the Netherdeep to ensure the source of ruidium is stable and under their control.
Their participation in faction conflicts is typically passive, as they defend ruidium and their
excavation from other factions and root out any spies among their midst rather than attacking
or interfering with other factions.

Major NPCs
James Cryon (LN Elf) - Headmaster of the Crystal Chateau
Gryz Alakirtos (NG Goblin) - Headmaster of the Teres Schoolhouse
Jor Raashid (LN Halfing) - Gatekeeper for the Crystal Chateau
Lymmle Wist (NE Human Mage) - Professor, spy for the Sentinels of Memory
Prolix Yusaf (LN Tiefling) - Agent
Kareema (NG Orc) - Relickeeper of the Ibis Relic Hall
Insight Acuere (LG Tiefling) - Professor, leader of the Cael Morrow Expedition
Galeokaerda (NE Elf) - Adjunct Professor, spy for the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream in Cael Morrow

Faction Objectives
- Recover a stolen figurine of wonderous power infused with ruidium. The figurine is currently at the Bone Garden,
  but the owner of the shop (Rerosha) has agreed to return it to the Allegiance of Allsight

- Investigate a possible secondary entrance to Cael Morrow through the Life Dome (this is a false lead
  planted by the Sentinels of Memory)

- Obtain stone tablets from a crumbling, flooded building in Cael Morrow (area M10)

- Enter the rift in Cael Morrow and confirm that ruidium can be found there

- Explore and secure the Netherdeep, and convince the "sorrowful intelligence" found within (Alyxian)
  to allow the Allegiance of Allsight to extract ruidium

## Cobalt Soul

The Cobalt Soul are allied with the Allegiance of Allsight, though they are more concerned with
the dangers ruidium poses than the Allegiance of Allsight. In general, the Cobalt Soul takes a
more active approach to faction conflict than the Allegiance of Allsight, consistent with their
mission to root out corruption and preserve truth and knowledge. Cobalt Soul operatives are
constantly scouting for information on potentially dangerous factions and act on that
information when they recieve it.

Major NPCs
Jamil A'alithiya (CG Human) - High Curator of the Ank'Harel branch of the Cobalt Soul
Iwo Zalarre (CG Half-Orc) - Operative
Question (CN Tielfing) - Operative

Faction Objectives
- Investigate a suspected Cultist of Zehir to determine his motives in Ank'Harel

- Obtain proof that Old Man Kruuk is selling dangerous black market magic items, then sieze any magic items
  he currently possesses

- Inflitrate First Eclipse - the headquarters of the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream

- Recover the "Key to the Netherdeep" that the Consortium seems to be after - revealed to be a Ruidium Greataxe
  found in the flooded Villa of Cael Morrow (area M13)

- Subdue or defeat the Alyxian Aboleth

- Cut off the supply of rudium after it is shown to be too dangerous


## Consortium of the Vermilion Dream

While the organization in general is devoted to the research of Ruidus, the Consortium's recent
efforts are focused on obtaining as much ruidium as possible and experimenting with the
substance to determine its potential. Additionally, they have other undertakings designed to
secure resources and funds for their ruidium plans.

Major NPCs
Five Masters:
Aradrine the Owl (LN Goliath)
Dendarron the Sun Bear (CN Halfling)
Larthul the Wolf (CE Human)
Khelkur the Gull (NE Dwarf)
Vrill the Moth (LE Elf)

Aloysia Telfan (LE Elf) - Agent
Satzrak Runestrider (NE Blue Dragonborn) - Owner of First Eclipse
Galeokaerda (NE Elf) - Adjunct Professor, spy for the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream in Cael Morrow
Ashann (CN Gnome) - Agent

Faction Objectives
- Purchase a ruidium shortsword from Old Man Kruuk

- Steal the ruidium infused Figurine of Wonderous Power from the Allegiance of Allsight. After acquiring it
  from the Bone Garden, the figurine is kept in the Relic Hall (area S4)

- Experiment with the ruidium infused Figurine of Wonderous Power to create two crystaline elephants,
  using First Eclipse as a base of operations for the test (after clearing out the secret basement)

- Obtain the "Key to the Netherdeep" - as identified by Consortium divers to be
  a ruidium greataxe in a sunken Cael Morrow Villa (area M13)

- Kill the Alyxian Aboleth so the path to the rift in Cael Morrow is clear

- Enter the Netherdeep and find the source of ruidium. If it's a creature, convince or force
  it to ally with the Consortium


## Sentinels of Memory

Primarily a political faction, the Sentinels of Memory seek to prevent the exploration of Cael
Morrow, believing the secrets of the past should not be uncovered. However, as it seems
politics alone will not stop the Allegiance of Allsight, some members have resorted to
espionage, sabotage, and violence to achieve their goals.

Major NPCs
Watcher Trast (N Elf) - Founder
Watcher Byron (LE Gnome) - Operations Manager
Watcher Lymmle Wist (NE Human Mage) - Professor, spy for the Sentinels of Memory

Faction Objectives
- Attack the Life Dome and frame an Allegiance member, such as Prolix Yusaf, for the the attack

- Steal ruidium items that the other factions recover from Cael Morrow, including the ruidium infused Figurine of Wonderous Power
