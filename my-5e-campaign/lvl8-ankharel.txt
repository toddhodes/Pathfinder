# Factions

Ank'Harel Faction Objectives and NPCs
https://www.reddit.com/r/CalloftheNetherdeep/comments/10fl5b4/ankharel_faction_objectives_and_npcs/


## Allegiance of Allsight

Generally, the Allegiance of Allsight are focused on their reseach of Cael Morrow, and later,
securing the Netherdeep to ensure the source of ruidium is stable and under their control.
Their participation in faction conflicts is typically passive, as they defend ruidium and their
excavation from other factions and root out any spies among their midst rather than attacking
or interfering with other factions.

Major NPCs
James Cryon (LN Elf) - Headmaster of the Crystal Chateau
Gryz Alakirtos (NG Goblin) - Headmaster of the Teres Schoolhouse
Jor Raashid (LN Halfing) - Gatekeeper for the Crystal Chateau
Lymmle Wist (NE Human Mage) - Professor, spy for the Sentinels of Memory
Prolix Yusaf (LN Tiefling) - Agent
Kareema (NG Orc) - Relickeeper of the Ibis Relic Hall
Insight Acuere (LG Tiefling) - Professor, leader of the Cael Morrow Expedition
Galeokaerda (NE Elf) - Adjunct Professor, spy for the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream in Cael Morrow

Faction Objectives
- Recover a stolen figurine of wonderous power infused with ruidium. The figurine is currently at the Bone Garden, 
  but the owner of the shop (Rerosha) has agreed to return it to the Allegiance of Allsight

- Investigate a possible secondary entrance to Cael Morrow through the Life Dome (this is a false lead 
  planted by the Sentinels of Memory)

- Obtain stone tablets from a crumbling, flooded building in Cael Morrow (area M10)

- Enter the rift in Cael Morrow and confirm that ruidium can be found there

- Explore and secure the Netherdeep, and convince the "sorrowful intelligence" found within (Alyxian) 
  to allow the Allegiance of Allsight to extract ruidium

## Cobalt Soul

The Cobalt Soul are allied with the Allegiance of Allsight, though they are more concerned with
the dangers ruidium poses than the Allegiance of Allsight. In general, the Cobalt Soul takes a
more active approach to faction conflict than the Allegiance of Allsight, consistent with their
mission to root out corruption and preserve truth and knowledge. Cobalt Soul operatives are
constantly scouting for information on potentially dangerous factions and act on that
information when they recieve it.

Major NPCs
Jamil A'alithiya (CG Human) - High Curator of the Ank'Harel branch of the Cobalt Soul
Iwo Zalarre (CG Half-Orc) - Operative
Question (CN Tielfing) - Operative

Faction Objectives
- Investigate a suspected Cultist of Zehir to determine his motives in Ank'Harel

- Obtain proof that Old Man Kruuk is selling dangerous black market magic items, then sieze any magic items 
  he currently possesses

- Inflitrate First Eclipse - the headquarters of the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream

- Recover the "Key to the Netherdeep" that the Consortium seems to be after - revealed to be a Ruidium Greataxe 
  found in the flooded Villa of Cael Morrow (area M13)

- Subdue or defeat the Alyxian Aboleth

- Cut off the supply of rudium after it is shown to be too dangerous


## Consortium of the Vermilion Dream

While the organization in general is devoted to the research of Ruidus, the Consortium's recent
efforts are focused on obtaining as much ruidium as possible and experimenting with the
substance to determine its potential. Additionally, they have other undertakings designed to
secure resources and funds for their ruidium plans.

Major NPCs
Five Masters:
Aradrine the Owl (LN Goliath)
Dendarron the Sun Bear (CN Halfling)
Larthul the Wolf (CE Human)
Khelkur the Gull (NE Dwarf)
Vrill the Moth (LE Elf)

Aloysia Telfan (LE Elf) - Agent
Satzrak Runestrider (NE Blue Dragonborn) - Owner of First Eclipse
Galeokaerda (NE Elf) - Adjunct Professor, spy for the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream in Cael Morrow
Ashann (CN Gnome) - Agent

Faction Objectives
- Purchase a ruidium shortsword from Old Man Kruuk

- Steal the ruidium infused Figurine of Wonderous Power from the Allegiance of Allsight. After acquiring it 
  from the Bone Garden, the figurine is kept in the Relic Hall (area S4)

- Experiment with the ruidium infused Figurine of Wonderous Power to create two crystaline elephants, 
  using First Eclipse as a base of operations for the test (after clearing out the secret basement)

- Obtain the "Key to the Netherdeep" - as identified by Consortium divers to be 
  a ruidium greataxe in a sunken Cael Morrow Villa (area M13)

- Kill the Alyxian Aboleth so the path to the rift in Cael Morrow is clear

- Enter the Netherdeep and find the source of ruidium. If it's a creature, convince or force 
  it to ally with the Consortium


## Sentinels of Memory

Primarily a political faction, the Sentinels of Memory seek to prevent the exploration of Cael
Morrow, believing the secrets of the past should not be uncovered. However, as it seems
politics alone will not stop the Allegiance of Allsight, some members have resorted to
espionage, sabotage, and violence to achieve their goals.

Major NPCs
Watcher Trast (N Elf) - Founder
Watcher Byron (LE Gnome) - Operations Manager
Watcher Lymmle Wist (NE Human Mage) - Professor, spy for the Sentinels of Memory

Faction Objectives
- Attack the Life Dome and frame an Allegiance member, such as Prolix Yusaf, for the the attack

- Steal ruidium items that the other factions recover from Cael Morrow, including the ruidium infused Figurine of Wonderous Power
