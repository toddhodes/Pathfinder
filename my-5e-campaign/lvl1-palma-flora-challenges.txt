# Arrival and visit

  A cool breeze drifts across Flora Isle, mingling the sweet scent of flowers with the
  salty tang of the Lucidian Ocean. Well-tanned locals play on the beach, while
  sunburned visitors sit in wicker chairs and sip cold drinks. Potential shark hunting
  particpants young and old can be seen standing in the shallows on the south shore,
  armed with harpoons, tridents, and an array of nautical themed gear.

  You spot some flyers and signs indicating there are other challenges for visitors, if
  you'd like to look into it.

  Options:
  - Tour the island or the city (start at center)
  - get drinks/food
  - sit on chair at beach
  - walk shops and tents for shopping

  earned enough tickets. (Magic items table B)
