## Phandalin / Finale of LMoP

  Level 4 ends at Wave Echo cave and a return to Phandalin.
  --> This section is a copy of the material at the end of mine-of-phandelver.txt
  Use that for Forge Details, this is the finale and linking to CotN.

 "Through canny execution and a bit of luck, you have 
  - defeated the Black Spider & his legion of minons,
  - cleared the Redbrand ruffian bandits, 
  - taken a dent out of the Cragmaw clan connected to him.

  Once a promising member of the Zadash outcasts who survived the monster pit massacre, is now a corpse.

  you have claimed the Pact of the Lost Mine of Phandelver,
  - it's Forge of Spells,
  - and Wave Echo Cave surrounding it

  Phandalin in not clear of all its many challenges, but, much has been set right.

  What lies ahead? Weeks or months needed to restore the mines,
  months or years needed to master the magic infusions and transfers of the Forge,
  a lifetime to undertand its connection to the Portal System.    ["Sigil"]

  the Phandelver's Pact has the potential to bring great riches to all who support it, and help
  establish a beachhead of peace and prosperity in the area otherwise only famous for terrible battles in a
  terrible war.

  Gundren and Nundro Rockseeker agree to take over administration of the mine.  You now set off to finalize
  the paperwork on the agreement due for your service, the award of a 10 percent share of the mine's profits.

### Signing Papers

Arriving in the Townmaster's Hall, you greet [Harbin Wester], 
Townmaster and Sherriff of Phandalin, and ex-pat aquaintence [Sildar Hallwinter].

 "Congrats on the pact.  It's a major change around here."
  Don't think I forgot about your reward -- give you 500gp Spider, 200gp glasstaff

  after papers are in order, he remarks:
  you are welcome to make a home here -- perhaps restoring Tresendar Manor for use when you are not
  at the Cave, or otherwise out in search of new adventures.

### Surprise Party

a crowd gathers at the Stonehill Inn

At first site of your return to the city, it seems an impromptu party has been set up at the Inn.

Toblen Stonehill, Elmar, Linene, Sister Garaele, the Eldermaths, and the Alderleafs.
and Ayo, Irvan Wastewalker, Maggie, and Dermot.

Irvan (Irwin) is already quite drunk, and pawing on Ajo, a wide smile across his face.

Linene takes out a lute and invites Rumble into a Bugbear jig in 5/4 time, one he knows from... somewhere.
You ask to borrow the instrument, and as you play, you are visited by a vision, and a name,
The Lute of the Beacon.

later, after the party and cheer, the party is approached by Maggie
guarded, lowered eye contact.

  "Dermot, we've had our fun.  Ask them"

  "Can we come with you?"

### Linking back to CotN

  "As for the jewel. That's waaay above my pay grade.  The best place for that locally is Boxy.
   Bozoxxon to the underdarkers.  It's the site of Betrayer's Rise, one of the final battles of the
   Calamity.  Its an entire mountain of shifting arcane passages and rooms connected
   to the betrayer gods and planes of hell, planes of dark, planes connected to that.
   The townsfolk are a hardy bunch, ones like Adam there, who wage a constant unending war
   against the leakage out of."

  "The passage to Boxy and Betrayer's Rise, is through the Barbed Fields.  Some of the darkest 
   poisoned land on the planet.  The fallout from the most epic battles of humanity.
   its a 10 day trek and do be careful."

  "Now, why would you ever go there?  Well, there's one other spot that was forever changed by the Calamity.
   Well, that didn't end up completely destroyed, like the Shattered Teeth.  And that's Marquest, that contient 
   far below east.  Now a desert, with its past half a mile below it.  The greatest scholars are in Marquet, but,
   they happen to send the scholars to Boxy.  There's 3-4 visiting and studying there for the organizations they
   represent and any given time.  Save you a two thousand mile trip going to Bozy first."

## Research the jewel or the location

### Jewel

Dermot:

  "What you have found is a Vestige of Divergence, an enchanted relic from the time of the
   Calamity known as the Jewel of Three Prayers. People do not stumble upon Vestiges without a
   reason.

  "Bazzoxan is a grim town under the control of the Aurora Watch, not a pleasant place to
   visit.  But I was in Bazzoxan once, where the legacy of the Calamity lingers more strongly
   anywhere else in Xhorhas, and I saw this very Jewel depicted on the walls of the Betrayers’
   Rise.  Perhaps you will find answers wth leading experts who congregrate there."

  "There are often leading experts from Ank’harel on field assignment in Bazzoxan.

  "Finally, I have a gift for you -- a journal of one of the explorers who delved too deep and awakened
  the abyssal gate in Bazzoxan. The end of the journal trails off into mad gibberings, but it
  includes a vivid description of a figure that resembles the one you saw in your vision."

### Location of Cyst of Avandra

  "It is said that during the time of the Calamity, Avandra blessed a site within Bazzoxan; it
   is described in some demonic texts as a “cyst” which blighted that temple of the Betrayers Gods"

  Avandra also appears in reference to a Vestige named the Kiss of the Changebringer:
  "Legend holds that Asmodeus stole this amulet from the neck of Avandra and locked it away within
   the vaults of Bazzoxan. In an expedition into the dark fortress's depths, the Kiss of the
   Changebringer was found and claimed by a group of Aurora Watch soldiers

#### Potential other Vestiges / Artifacts

  - Kiss of the Changebringer - saves, no grappled, blink
  - Hide of the Feral Guardian - armor, polymorph, polymorphs get +N
  - Wreath of the Prism - dominate monster
  - Stormgirdle - too strong

#### Arms of the Betrayers - Anti-Vestiges

Ruin's Wake
   Perigee sacrifice herself at the battle of the barbed fields to kill Yarrowish, who was sent to
   the Abyss. After the battle, Gruumsh took his soul and turned it into Ruin's Wake, using it as
   the spear he "smote" Alyxian with.
   - It was forged in the War Fires of the Endless Battlefield of Acheron using the soul of a
     slaughter-loving Balor named Yarrowish.
   - It was used by the Ruiner to bring low a hero blessed by three Prime Deities and hit the
     continent of Marquet with such force that it was said to have torn open a rift to the elemental plane of water.
   - It was deflected from its intended target and was flung far to the northeast, where it was
     recovered by demon acolytes of Baphomet and hidden away in the depths of the Seat of the Demon
     Princes, now known as Betrayer's Rise.

  "You are about a day away from Bazzoxan. Full Ruidus happened the night before giving you all
   a sense of unease, especially those of you with faith."

 When Perigee did her final strike against the Betrayer general, she damaged the surroundings
 and weakened the barrier between the material realm and the Abyss.
 the Abyssal rift in Betrayers' Rise has never fully closed, and are a hot-spot for demons.
 Aurora Watch patrols check often and try to keep the demon numbers down.

## Canonical Order of Events

## Revelation List: Lore of Alyxian

- History of the Jewel of Three Prayers.
- The Jewel of Three Prayers was empowered by the gods three times.
- Shrines were erected near each location where the Jewel was empowered.
- The Jewel can be fully reactivated by visiting the shrines.
- Ruidium is appearing in sites associated with the Apotheon.
- Properties of ruidium.
- The Lore of the Alyxian
- Alyxian's Sacrifices:
When Alyxian prayed to Sehanine, he gave up his future
When he prayed to Avandra in Betrayer's Rise, he gave up his present
When he and his followers left Wildemount to help in Marquet, giving up his past


## CORE STRUCTURE of Call of the Netherdeep

  In Ank’harel there are three factions — the Allegiance of Allsight, the Consortium of
  Vermilion Dreams, and the Library of the Cobalt Soul.

  Each faction has a specific ruidium agenda regarding ruidium. (The Allegiance wants to use it
  to become arms dealers; the Consortium wants to monopolize it for arcane research; the
  Library wants it destroyed.)

  Each faction has sent a researcher to Bazzoxan — Prolix Yusaf (Allegiance), Aloysia Telfin
  Consortium), and Question (Library).

  The PCs should arrive in Bazzoxan and befriend a researcher (or more than one).

  The PCs will follow the researcher(s) back to Ank’harel and join a faction (or more than one,
  although that probably won’t remain tenable given the factions’ mutually contradictory
  goals).

  The PCs will then perform faction missions, which lead them to Cael Morrow and then the Netherdeep.
