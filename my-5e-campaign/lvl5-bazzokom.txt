Chapter 3a - Bazzoxan
 + The Hythenos Estate
 + On a Red Rock Trail

## Hook reminder

“I was in Bazzoxan once, where the legacy of the Calamity lingers more strongly anywhere
 else in Xhorhas, and I saw this very Jewel depicted on the walls of the Betrayers’ Rise.
 Perhaps you will find answers there.”

Three Scholars of Ank’Harel in Bazzoxan (Question, Prolix, and Aloysia) 


## Approach Betrayer's Rise

Many entrances; 
ruidium is specifically found around this entrance and in this micro-dungeon
find this one, or, get a guide to the bas relief, or, steal notes to it.

"The Doors of The Laughing Hand, champion of Torog. Speak, friend, and enter."
And underneath small and faint is written: "Durham of Zeidel drew these signs"


# Factions

clarify conflicting motivations:

- Allegiance of Allsight (Prolix) want to use the ruidium to create weapons, armor, and other
  artifacts that they can sell to the highest bidder.

- Consortium of Vermilion Dreams (Aloysia) want to secure a monopoly on ruidium so that they
  can study its deeper mysteries and have sole access to its power.

- Library of the Cobalt Soul (Question) believe that ruidium is dangerous and it must be either
  destroyed or sealed away so that it cannot harm the world.

  have rivals choose differently
