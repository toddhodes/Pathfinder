# Level 5 / Chapter 3(b) - Bazzoxan

5th	Chpt 3a: Bazzoxan city (B1-B7) + edge of the Rise
 + The Hythenos Estate + On a Red Rock Trail
 "There are often leading experts from Ank’harel on field assignment in Bazzoxan."


## Approach

 "Jutting from the rusty orange mountains of eastern Xhorhas are tall spires of black stone.
  The unmistakable outline of Betrayer's rise.

  A stunning structure to behold, the infamous Betrayers' Rise is both ominous and beautiful.
  Its black walls are carved with intricate Bas relief; grotesques of gargoyles & demons peer down from high above.

  The Betrayer Gods spent centuries infusing and expanding its interiors, investing blood and coin
  into carved rock, in famously shifting and ambiguous paths.

  Vast resources were used to defend this fortress-temple against the Prime Deities. It's fall and
  the taking of Ghor Dhranas were the final blows ending the Calamity.

  Ahead of you, beneath the spires, camped in the shadows of its front cliff face, is the garrison town of Boxy.
  Tall stone walls surround it, with iron watchtowers spaced irregularly.
  Soldiers of the Aurora Watch patrol the tops of the walls, and a single central gate manages entry.


## Enter Gate

  [if they approach:] a guard on the wall calls out, calmly, "Identify!"
    --> to talk to Theyres, go to the gatehold barraks

  "From around the corner of a crumbling building, five twitching masses of
   eyes and mouths wriggle into view. One of them is shredding the flesh of a hapless
   soldier in three of its amorphous maws. Trumpets blare an alarm, and several Aurora Watch
   soldiers hurry into the streets.

   Your accompanyment, the male drow, breaks to charge, and yells back:
   "Newcomers, No time for pleasantries — draw your weapons or get to safety! Go to the barracks after!"

  Civilians head for secure buildings while members of the Aurora Watch mobilize to engage the threat

  End: bring wounded to infirmary, roam at will, meet at gatehold at your leisure

## Faction Hooks

 Ank’harel main factions
   — the Allegiance of Allsight
     researcher: Prolix Yusaf (Allegiance)
     agenda: The Allegiance wants to use it to become arms dealers

   - the Consortium of Vermilion Dreams
     researcher: Aloysia Telfin (Consortium)
     agenda: the Consortium wants to monopolize it for arcane research

   - the Library of the Cobalt Soul
     researcher: Question (Library)
     agenda: the Library wants it destroyed

  Players goal:
  - befriend a researcher (or more than one).
  DM goal:
  - follow the researcher(s) back to Ank’harel and join a faction (or more than one)
  - perform faction missions, which lead them to Cael Morrow and then the Netherdeep.

 Scholars of Ank’Harel in Bazzoxan (Question, Prolix, and Aloysia):
  - Aloysia will attempt to eavesdrop on conversations between the PCs and other scholars. (And can be caught.)
    She asks the PCs to distract Prolix so that she can slip away and do something without his prying eyes.
  - Prolix tells the PCs that he’s been sent primarily to spy on Aloysia.
    Ask them to break into Aloysia’s room and steal her notes.
  - Question suspects that one of the other Ank’harel researchers has stolen one of his
    sketchbooks. She’d like the PCs to recover it.

 Clarify conflicting motivations:
   - Consortium of Vermilion Dreams (Aloysia) want to secure a monopoly on ruidium so that they
     can study its deeper mysteries and have sole access to its power.
   - Allegiance of Allsight (Prolix) want to use the ruidium to create weapons, armor, and other
     artifacts that they can sell to the highest bidder.
   - Library of the Cobalt Soul (Question) believe that ruidium is dangerous and it must be either
     destroyed or sealed away so that it cannot harm the world.


## Locations

 A. Sacrifice Engines
    "Among the most prominent features of Bazzoxan are the town's two sacrifice engines, each one
    a 30-foot-deep pit lined with rows of silver blades.  in bygone days, servants of the
    Betrayer Gods threw mortals into these pits to appease them.  Now, the Aurora Watch herds
    demons and other monsters into them.

 1. Gate - intro fight, 5 gibbering mouthers, Verin Thelyss
 2. Crematorium - Prolix, Allegiance of Allsight.
   Thick smoke billows from the chimneys of this stone building. Corpses wrapped in beige cloth are stacked in
   a small yard northeast of the building.  A willowy man wearing a leather apron greets you at the entrance with dour
   cheer. "New bodies for Bazzoxan, I see." Behind him stands a giant man: muscular, blue-eyed, with short-cropped hair
   and a missing arm.
  - off to the side, a bookish tiefling is awkwardly poking at a dead vrock, repulsive, which oddly hasn't dissolved into a pool of
   ichor as it should have, which suggests some sort of abnormality. the tiefling has a variety of archaeology tools hang at his waist
   along with a satchel holding notebooks. he explains "We can't burn this yet. something is off."
   once he sees you staring, he Reaches into the satchel, and pulls out a badge and holds it up, as if the badge alone
   explained his reason for being here.  The badge displays the symbol of his faction: a scroll bearing a single, watchful eye.
   - Allegiance of Allsight

  - hi, i'm Prolix!  archaeologist from Ank'Harel, a city on the distant continent of Marquet.
  - vrocks often swallow jewelry and other ornamental objects

       aura of abjuration magic.   DC 20 Intelligence to open
    --> Prolix grabs box
        body starts to dissolve

   "I'm an archaeologist, but I'm not here to perform archaeology, per se. I was sent by the Allegiance of
    Allsight to spy on a rival agent of the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream." Prolix says that the Allegiance
    doesn't know why the Consortium dispatched someone to Bazzoxan, but the reason can't be good.  [Aloysia]

   "She's looking for something in the Betrayers' Rise. She's not hard to spot. Tall, pale, dressed in red.
    Cold-blooded. Seems like she'd do anything to get what she wants. And what she wants is... well, that's what
    I'd like to know!"

  - we should  break into her [Aloysia’s] room and steal her notes.  (at the Ready Room).
   [Allegiance of Allsight (Prolix) want to use the ruidium to create weapons, armor, and other
     artifacts that they can sell to the highest bidder.  agenda: The Allegiance wants to use it to become arms dealers]
  - "Can i see that item?" draws sketch
    - invites the characters to return with him to the Crystal Chateau, his university in Ank'Harel,
    - mentions Question

 3. Infirmary
  - 3 buildings on the perimeter of the central square have doors marked with a symbol of a hand alight with magic.
    you enter &
   "The walls are lined with shelves that hold old books and medical supplies. The floor is crammed with
    narrow cots. There's a small office in the back, its door ajar, and the air reeks of medicinal poultices.
  - a drow priest is chatting with a young wounded female drow edge of bed.
    Other wounded patients -- most of them asleep -- fill the infirmary bed
  - approaches, concerned look.  "hello friends.  are you well? i'm Bautha Dyrr."
     DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check:
     - pin in the shape of a black wing attached to Bautha's cloak is holy symbol of Xalicas,
       a solar who served as the right hand of Corellon the Arch Heart before falling in the Calamity
  - "ok?  great.  the violence here is... horrible"

  --> as yoyu leave, wounded member of the AW calls out.
     [Naevyn Tasithar].
    "can you get me my satchel? pulls out small tiger's eye carving of a rabbit with a name carved into.
    "can you bring this to the Wall of the Unforgotten?"

 4. Gatehold Barracks -
   "These barracks are filled with the sounds of chatter, voices shouting orders, and clanging metal. Armored
    Aurora Watch soldiers go about their business, performing drills and sharpening weapons.

   - four main sections: war room, mess hall, training area, sleeping quarters.
   - "Taskhand Verin Thelyss is expecting you"... a soldier leads them to the war room.

       Most residents are drow, but some goblins, hobgoblins, bugbears, orcs, and other Xhorhasian folk live here as well.
    Incursions:
     - dretches, quasits, mouthers, and other lesser demons created by demons in the Betrayers' Rise are common threats.
       On rare occasions, more powerful demons attack, or demonic energy animates the bodies of dead Aurora Watch soldiers.
    Researchers:
    - expedition from the Library of the Cobalt Soul is currently in the Betrayers' Rise with an
      Aurora Watch escort, researching battles of the Calamity that took place within its halls.
    - agent of the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream is staying in Bazzoxan. an elf named Aloysia,
      reprimanded for trying to bribe Aurora Watch soldiers to protect her while she searches for an
      ancient holy site she claims is within the Betrayers' Rise.
    - archaeologist named Prolix from the Allegiance of Allsight in Ank'Harel also recently
      arrived in Bazzoxan. He is ostensibly assisting Aurora Watch arcanists who are researching
      ways to seal the rift within the Betrayers' Rise. Verin suspects that the archaeologist has
      other motives, seen lurking around the crematorium.

    Betrayers' Rise:
   "There has been recent uptick in activity and interest. Larger rifts are appearing.
    I have sent out scouting parties and arcane experts into BR. None of the expeditions have been fruitful so far."
    [Verin can't spare any more personnel]

   "challenging to navigate. passages shift to confuse. if you get lost down there, my soldiers won't be able to find you."

 4. b. Mess Hall:
     - A member of the Cobalt Soul expedition, a tiefling named Question, went with his group
       to the gate of the Betrayers' Rise but elected not to enter the place. He's holed up at
       the Ready Room, ready to talk about his research
     - An elf named Aloysia tried to bribe some soldiers into escorting her into the Betrayers'
       Rise.  Some people believe that she wants only to ransack the temple, but others think her
       concern is religious and she is searching for long-lost lore about the Prime Deities.

 4. c. Barracks Training: Shooting Match.  Sparring Match.  Wrestling Match.

 5. Dilapidated Temple
     "what might have been a flourishing, spiral-shaped temple has fallen into disrepair"
     "Glass crunches underfoot amid overgrown weeds. Collapsed walls have been replaced with rows
      of wooden shelves that hold earthenware pots. Numerous alcoves are being used as planters for
      stubborn flora. Just outside the far end of the enclosure, a smashed mosaic of stained glass
      sits in a splintered window frame next to a withered, skeletal tree."
    --> DC 17 (Religion): mosaic once depicted a woman's face on a golden disk: the iconography of Avandra the Change Bringer.
    a firbolg [Fogholm] tends to the greenery - [Melora the Wild Mother, recognizes Avandra]
     - No vegetation survives for long in Bazzoxan.  He hopes to honor both deities by cultivating new life"
     - While meditating the other night, he felt something surge within the earth nearby
     - if given jewel: three fragments of divine power within it, one awake and two slumbering

    "The Kryn capital of Rosohna was the Betrayer Gods' citadel of Ghor Dranas in the time before the
     Calamity, and the Betrayers' Rise was once a fortress protecting Ghor Dranas. In the darkest days of the
     Calamity, the Prime Deities and their most loyal champions laid siege to Ghor Dranas before capturing the
     Betrayers' Rise and routing the Betrayer Gods' forces there. Though storytellers have long since forgotten
     the names of many of those heroes, the force of their bonds still resonates across the land."

 6. Wall of the Unforgotten 
  "A stretch of stone wall is carved with names and wreathed in dried flowers, silver necklaces, and ropes weighted
   with good-luck charms. The ground near the wall is cluttered with trinkets left there as offerings.  A drow of the
   Aurora Watch prays near a corner of the wall.  The wall is crowded with names, most scratched into the surface with knives."
   - 300yo drow priest [Kalym Telaarin].  left leg is an intricate prosthetic carved from chitinous black rock and ringed with bands

  navigated.

Many entrances;

## On a Red Rock Trail

   The focus of this quest is to find and steal back a shipment of Ruidium that Aloysia Teflan was forwarding to
   Ank’Harel by way of a local fence. The Ruidium was stolen by the Myriad who recently heard word about a strange
   red substance that had been reportedly recovered by some dungeon delvers. Their boss wanted it to see what they
   could get for it on the black market. Unfortunately the theft impacts Aloysia’s plans and status as a good
   operative for the Consortium, and she wants it back badly enough to pay some adventurers to help.

# Introduce other lvl 5-8 content

 - James:
   In rexentruum, entire private bar.  person recognizes you and asks how Jace is.  Person next to him visibily stiffens.
   Says in thieves kant, "you haven't heard?".  explains the following:
    Jace Slumber was running high-level battlefield caliber arcane weaponry, rumored to be from Ruins of Molaesmyr in
    the Savalirwood or the Aeor crash site. selling to the highest bidder.  We're talking 100k GP here.
    This was a bidding between the highest levels of the dynasty and empire.  the Bright Queen and King Bertrand Dwendal
    would have to have been invovled to sign off.  then he disappeared.  Jace is the consumate smuggler. doesn't ply in
    trouble.  we made careful inquiries.  he is alive.  but must have learned something he shouldn't have, and is being
    held by one side or the other, in either capital, Roshana (Shadowspire) or Rexxentrum (Claykeep Prison).  or other secure place.
    if you want to break him out, the only organization who can help with that is the Golden Vault.  To meet with them,
    make a request for a meeting via the pirate network.  when you do -- make sure the responder has the right accent of
    thieves kant.  there are secrets getting out and rumors of a double agent in the ranks.

       Rumored to be associated with metallic dragons, the Golden Vault is a secretive
       organization that has its base on one of the good-aligned Outer Planes. Its membership
       and activities are almost impossible for outsiders to track, but those in the know are
       aware that the organization rights moral wrongs, supports virtuous underdogs, and
       handles delicate situations local authorities won't touch. The Golden Vault's motto
       reflects its primary motivation: "Do good, no matter the cost." Missions from the Golden
       Vault are often illegal, but they always support a just, moral cause.

 - Ryan:
   The archmage Keraptis has the Lute of the Beacon at White Plume Mountain.  a person of the right lineage can
   play the lute and discover the song of the lute of the beacon, whose lyrics might lead to the first clues of
   that lineage's generational goals.

   In the Biting North, beyond the Greying Wildlands and into the islands of Eiselcross, lies a miniature companion to
   Kravaarad: White Plume Mountain.
   [Kravaarad: North of Uthodurn, in the heart of the Floktet Alps, where the snowy landscape is defiantly interrupted
    by the black and ever-smoldering volcano]

   White Plume Mountain has always been a subject of superstitious awe to the neighboring
   villagers. People still travel many miles to gaze upon this natural wonder, though few will approach it
   closely, as it is reputed to be the haunt of various demons and devils. The occasional disappearance of
   those who stray too close to the Plume reinforces this belief.

   It is rumored that Thirteen hundred years ago, the wizard Keraptis was searching for a suitable haven where
   he could indulge his eccentricities without fear of interference. He visited White Plume Mountain, going
   closer than most dared to, and took it over, privoding who knows what kind of alterations.  he disappeared
   below White Plume Mountain and vanished from the stories of the surface world.

   Several weeks ago, three highly valued magic weapons named Wave, Whelm, and Blackrazor
   disappeared from the vaults of their owners. Rewards were posted, servants hanged, even the
   sanctuary of the thieves' guild was violated in the frantic search for the priceless arms,
   but not even a single clue was turned up until the weapons' former owners each received a
   copy of the following note: ...

   The Lute of the Beacon is disguised as Whelm
