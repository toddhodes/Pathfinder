# Level 5 / Chapter 3(b) - Bazzoxan 

5th	Chpt 3a: Bazzoxan city (B1-B7) + edge of the Rise
 + The Hythenos Estate
 + On a Red Rock Trail

  set CORE STRUCTURE of Call of the Netherdeep

  In Ank’harel there are three factions — the Allegiance of Allsight, the Consortium of
  Vermilion Dreams, and the Library of the Cobalt Soul.

  Each faction has a specific ruidium agenda regarding ruidium. (The Allegiance wants to use it
  to become arms dealers; the Consortium wants to monopolize it for arcane research; the
  Library wants it destroyed.)

  Each faction has sent a researcher to Bazzoxan — Prolix Yusaf (Allegiance), Aloysia Telfin
  Consortium), and Question (Library).

  The PCs should arrive in Bazzoxan and befriend a researcher (or more than one).

  The PCs will follow the researcher(s) back to Ank’harel and join a faction (or more than one,
  although that probably won’t remain tenable given the factions’ mutually contradictory
  goals).

  The PCs will then perform faction missions, which lead them to Cael Morrow and then the Netherdeep.


## Hook reminder

 re-read research -- jewel, names, places

 Scholars of Ank’Harel in Bazzoxan (Question, Prolix, and Aloysia) 


## Approach Betrayer's Rise

Many entrances; 
ruidium is specifically found around this entrance and in this micro-dungeon
find this one, or, get a guide to the bas relief, or, steal notes to it.

"The Doors of The Laughing Hand, champion of Torog. Speak, friend, and enter."
 And underneath small and faint is written: "Durham of Zeidel drew these signs"


# Factions

clarify conflicting motivations:

- Library of the Cobalt Soul (Question) believe that ruidium is dangerous and it must be either
  destroyed or sealed away so that it cannot harm the world.

- Allegiance of Allsight (Prolix) want to use the ruidium to create weapons, armor, and other
  artifacts that they can sell to the highest bidder.

- Consortium of Vermilion Dreams (Aloysia) want to secure a monopoly on ruidium so that they
  can study its deeper mysteries and have sole access to its power.

  have rivals choose differently
