# Factions

clarify conflicting motivations:

- Allegiance of Allsight (Prolix) want to use the ruidium to create weapons, armor, and other
  artifacts that they can sell to the highest bidder.

- Consortium of Vermilion Dreams (Aloysia) want to secure a monopoly on ruidium so that they
  can study its deeper mysteries and have sole access to its power.

- Library of the Cobalt Soul (Question) believe that ruidium is dangerous and it must be either
  destroyed or sealed away so that it cannot harm the world.
