# Level 5 / Chapter 3(b) - Bazzoxan

5th	Chpt 3a: Bazzoxan city (B1-B7) + edge of the Rise
 + The Hythenos Estate
 + On a Red Rock Trail
 "There are often leading experts from Ank’harel on field assignment in Bazzoxan."


## Approach

 "Jutting from the rusty orange mountains of eastern Xhorhas are tall spires of black stone.
  The unmistakable outline of Betrayer's rise.

  A stunning structure to behold, the infamous Betrayers' Rise is both ominous and beautiful. 
  Its black walls are carved with intricate Bas relief; grotesques of gargoyles & demons peer down from high above. 

  The Betrayer Gods spent centuries infusing and expanding its interiors, investing blood and coin
  into carved rock, in famously shifting and ambiguous paths.  

  Vast resources were used to defend this fortress-temple against the Prime Deities. It's fall and 
  the taking of Ghor Dhranas were the final blows ending the Calamity.

  Ahead of you, beneath the spires, camped in the shadows of its front cliff face, is the garrison town of Boxy. 
  Tall stone walls surround it, with iron watchtowers spaced irregularly.
  Soldiers of the Aurora Watch patrol the tops of the walls, and a single central gate manages entry.  


## Enter Gate

  [if they approach:] a guard on the wall calls out, calmly, "Identify!""
    --> to talk to Theyres, go to the gatehold barraks

  "From around the corner of a crumbling building, five twitching masses of 
   eyes and mouths wriggle into view. One of them is shredding the flesh of a hapless
   soldier in three of its amorphous maws. Trumpets blare an alarm, and several Aurora Watch
   soldiers hurry into the streets. 

   Your accompanyment, the male drow, breaks to charge, and yells back:
   "Newcomers, No time for pleasantries — draw your weapons or get to safety! Go to the barracks after!"

  Civilians head for secure buildings while members of the Aurora Watch mobilize to engage the threat

  End: bring wounded to infirmary, roam at will, meet at gatehold at your leisure

## Faction Hooks

 Ank’harel main factions
   — the Allegiance of Allsight
     researcher: Prolix Yusaf (Allegiance)
     agenda: The Allegiance wants to use it to become arms dealers

   - the Consortium of Vermilion Dreams
     researcher: Aloysia Telfin (Consortium)
     agenda: the Consortium wants to monopolize it for arcane research

   - the Library of the Cobalt Soul
     researcher: Question (Library)
     agenda: the Library wants it destroyed

  Players goal:
  - befriend a researcher (or more than one).
  DM goal:
  - follow the researcher(s) back to Ank’harel and join a faction (or more than one)
  - perform faction missions, which lead them to Cael Morrow and then the Netherdeep.

 Scholars of Ank’Harel in Bazzoxan (Question, Prolix, and Aloysia):
  - Aloysia will attempt to eavesdrop on conversations between the PCs and other scholars. (And
   can be caught doing so by attentive PCs.) She might also ask the PCs to distract Prolix so that
   she can slip away and do something without his prying eyes.

  - Prolix may tell the PCs that he’s been sent primarily to spy on Aloysia. And we can
   strengthen this by having Prolix ask them to break into Aloysia’s room and steal her notes.

  - Question suspects that one of the other Ank’harel researchers has stolen one of his
   sketchbooks. She’d like the PCs to recover it.

 Clarify conflicting motivations:
   - Consortium of Vermilion Dreams (Aloysia) want to secure a monopoly on ruidium so that they
     can study its deeper mysteries and have sole access to its power.
   - Allegiance of Allsight (Prolix) want to use the ruidium to create weapons, armor, and other
     artifacts that they can sell to the highest bidder.
   - Library of the Cobalt Soul (Question) believe that ruidium is dangerous and it must be either
     destroyed or sealed away so that it cannot harm the world.


## Locations

 Anywhere
  - Most of the town's inhabitants are soldiers but has supporting civilians and researchers and religious figures.
    Most residents are drow, but some goblins, hobgoblins, bugbears, orcs, and other Xhorhasian folk live here as well.
  - Incursions: dretches, quasits, mouthers, and other lesser demons created by demons in the Betrayers' Rise are common threats.
    On rare occasions, more powerful demons attack, or demonic energy animates the bodies of dead Aurora Watch soldiers.

 A. Sacrifice Engines
    "Among the most prominent features of Bazzoxan are the town's two sacrifice engines, each one
    a 30-foot-deep pit lined with rows of silver blades.  in bygone days, servants of the
    Betrayer Gods threw mortals into these pits to appease them.  Now, the Aurora Watch herds
    demons and other monsters into them.

 4a. Gatehold Garracks War Room: Verin give info:
    - expedition from the Library of the Cobalt Soul is currently in the Betrayers' Rise with an
      Aurora Watch escort, researching battles of the Calamity that took place within its halls.

    - agent of the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream is staying in Bazzoxan. an elf named Aloysia, 
      reprimanded for trying to bribe Aurora Watch soldiers to protect her while she searches for an 
      ancient holy site she claims is within the Betrayers' Rise.

    - archaeologist named Prolix from the Allegiance of Allsight in Ank'Harel also recently
      arrived in Bazzoxan. He is ostensibly assisting Aurora Watch arcanists who are researching
      ways to seal the rift within the Betrayers' Rise. Verin suspects that the archaeologist has
      other motives, seen lurking around the crematorium.

    Betrayers' Rise: 
    "might hold the solution to breaking the stalemate that grips the town. I have sent out
     scouting parties and arcane experts to confirm that idea. None of the expeditions have
     been fruitful so far." [Verin can't spare any more personnel]

    "is... challenging to navigate. Its passages shift to confuse mapmakers
     and search parties. the Abyss flows through it, warping the environment so no two groups follow the same path. 
     if you get lost down there, my soldiers won't be able to find you."

 4b. Gatehold Garracks Mess Hall:
     -  member of the Cobalt Soul expedition, a tiefling named Question, went with his group
        to the gate of the Betrayers' Rise but elected not to enter the place. He's holed up at
        the Ready Room (area B7), ready to talk about his research
     - An elf named Aloysia tried to bribe some soldiers into escorting her into the Betrayers'
       Rise.  Some people believe that she wants only to ransack the temple, but others think her
       concern is religious and she is searching for long-lost lore about the Prime Deities.

 5. Dilapidated Temple
     "Glass crunches underfoot amid overgrown weeds. Collapsed walls have been replaced with rows
      of wooden shelves that hold earthenware pots. Numerous alcoves are being used as planters for
      stubborn flora. Just outside the far end of the enclosure, a smashed mosaic of stained glass
      sits in a splintered window frame next to a withered, skeletal tree."
      DC 17 (Religion): mosaic once depicted a woman's face on a golden disk: the iconography of Avandra the Change Bringer.
    Fogholm - worships Melora the Wild Mother, but recognizes the temple as a former holy place of Avandra the Change Bringer.

## Approach Betrayer's Rise

  Its exterior is in a wide variety of styles from various locations or planes or Gods; these
  include many potential entrances, or study locations, tho these are mostly inaccessible due
  to inscrutible entrance instructions, runes to be interpreted, and likely traps to be
  navigated.

Many entrances; 
ruidium is specifically found around this entrance and in this micro-dungeon
find this one, or, get a guide to the bas relief, or, steal notes to it.

"The Doors of The Laughing Hand, champion of Torog. Speak, friend, and enter."
 And underneath small and faint is written: "Durham of Zeidel drew these signs"

## Rewards of Study 

 add to one of Question's journal pages a Poem
   "O Ruidus, grant humble chorus leave To sing the song which hails the zenith of Your
   accursed, thrice-blessed Apotheon; Remembered best by deeds in war, and yet Whose acts were
   driven oft by fate most foul.
   His kindly brow bore gifts from gods of change, And art, and moon, yet in his soul was pain,
   The suffering of your vermilion light Drove the Paragon to a desert realm Bestrewn with
   blades and drenched in crimson blood.
   So hear, O moon of cursed deeds and fates! The song of he who rose above your great And
   mighty pow'r, to save Exandria. From the flames of war fanned by The Ruiner's blade."

   a warrior who’s name is unknown fought in betrayers rise and fell with the sunken city of Cael Morrow

   texts might have made it out about the histories of the Battle of the Barbed
   Fields and a twice-blessed hero who led the charge to storm the gates of Bazzoxan.
