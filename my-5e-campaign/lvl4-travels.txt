Runs down characters:
 "Congrats on the festival, hope you had fun, winning is a pretty big honor down there.
  May your hangovers by fleeting.

  Anyway, let me see if I get this straight:
  - I hear you're some kind of war hero or apostate or both. Don't say much, but with that
    on my shoulders, I get that
  - And you, aquatic one from the coast, with an old captain caught up in the war?
    I reckon your some kind of pirate, tho you certainly hold your cards close on that that bit.
    Well, that makes sense.
  - And, you [motions to Bottom], Dermot seems to indicate your one of them, whatever the fuck that
    is.  Looking for a family that's literally already dead.  Well, I've heard way weirder.
    Long as it ain't necromancy I have no problems connecting with the dead.
  - And then we got this living miracle of a mechanical man, as i live and breathe!  Trying to understand
    your connections inside you.  and i guess their connection to the rest of the living world.
    I wish you the best on both.
  - Now that just leaves you [motions at Adam].  fighting for truth justice and freedom, the morals and ethics
    of it all?  not quite sure what side your on, who you're fighting for, but I think the blood on your sword
    comes from a good place.

 "Now.. I'm no sherriff" as he taps a 7-pointed star casually on the desk, 
  and there's no democracy electing me to speak for everyone, but I think I do when I say,
  we got some troubles."

  "As for the jewel. That's waaay above my pay grade.  The best place for that locally is Boxy.
   Bozoxxon to the underdarkers.  It's the site of Betrayer's Rise, one of the final battles of the
   Calamity.  Its an entire mountain of shifting arcane passages and rooms connected
   to the betrayer gods and planes of hell, planes of dark, planes connected to that.
   The townsfolk are a hardy bunch, ones like Adam there, who wage a constant unending war
   against the leakage out of."

  "The passage to Boxy and Betrayer's Rise, is through the Barbed Fields.  Some of the darkest 
   poisoned land on the planet.  The fallout from the most epic battles of humanity.
   its a 10 day trek and do be careful."

  "Now, why would you ever go there?  Well, there's one other spot that was forever changed by the Calamity.
   Well, that didn't end up completely destroyed, like the Shattered Teeth.  And that's Marquest, that contient 
   far below east.  Now a desert, with its past half a mile below it.  The greatest scholars are in Marquet, but,
   they happen to send the scholars to Boxy.  There's 3-4 visiting and studying there for the organizations they
   represent and any given time.  Save you a two thousand mile trip going to Bozy first."


  "But, again, wouldn't be so bad if you could help with at least with the complex under Tresendar Manor, if
   nothing else."

### Potential other Vestiges

  - Hide of the Feral Guardian - armor, polymorph, polymorphs get +N
  - Wreath of the Prism - dominate monster
  - Stormgirdle - too strong


## Research the jewel or the location

 "You must find me! You must bring the Jewel to the Cyst of Avandra!" [within Betrayer’s Rise beneath Bazzoxan]

### Jewel

Orc Elder Ushru / whoever / the Unbroken Tusk inn

  "What you have found is a Vestige of Divergence, an enchanted relic from the time of the
  Calamity known as the Jewel of Three Prayers. People do not stumble upon Vestiges without a
  reason.

  "Bazzoxan is a grim town under the control of the Aurora Watch, not a pleasant place to
   visit.  But I was in Bazzoxan once, where the legacy of the Calamity lingers more strongly
   anywhere else in Xhorhas, and I saw this very Jewel depicted on the walls of the Betrayers’
   Rise.  Perhaps you will find answers wth leading experts who congregrate there."

  "There are often leading experts from Ank’harel on field assignment in Bazzoxan.

Someone else: Dermot?

  "I have a gift for you -- a journal of one of the explorers who delved too deep and awakened
  the abyssal gate in Bazzoxan. The end of the journal trails off into mad gibberings, but it
  includes a vivid description of a figure that resembles the one you saw in your vision."

### Who is Avandra / Location of Cyst of Avandra

  the name appears in reference to a Vestige named the Kiss of the Changebringer:
  "Legend holds that Asmodeus stole this amulet from the neck of Avandra and locked it away within
   the vaults of Bazzoxan. In an expedition into the dark fortress's depths, the Kiss of the
   Changebringer was found and claimed by a group of Aurora Watch soldiers

  "It is said that during the time of the Calamity, Avandra blessed a site within Bazzoxan; it
   is described in some demonic texts as a “cyst” which blighted that temple of the Betrayers Gods"

### Alyxian

 no info -- "There are often leading experts from Ank’harel on field assignment in Bazzoxan.

  "You are about a day away from Bazzoxan. Full Ruidus happened the night before giving you all
   a sense of unease, especially those of you with faith."

 When Perigee did her final strike against the Betrayer general, she damaged the surroundings
 and weakened the barrier between the material realm and the Abyss.
 the Abyssal rift in Betrayers' Rise has never fully closed, and are a hot-spot for demons.
 Aurora Watch patrols check often and try to keep the demon numbers down.

#### Encounter

  "Rising up before you is the old crest of a ruined citadel, walls tumbled down and cracked.
   You hear scraping rock, low guttural exhortions, and cries of combat."

- 6 Aurora Watch (AW) is already fighting some unusually high level demons
  - 2/6 are down (bleed out in 2 turns if nothing is done)
- fighting a Hezrou and a Draegloth, with a hidden Babau using its Gaze.

- Round 1:

   - Lair actions: The PCs make a Cha save DC 13. On fail, they take 2d6 necro as hands from
     the fog suck the life from them (this cuts through temp hp). Half on a save. Fail by more
     than 5, their max hp is reduced.

- Round 2: 1 Draegloth and 4 Wretched.

   - Lair actions: Wis save DC 13 as they are wracked by sorrow. On fail, uncontrollable
     tears fall; their speed is cut in half and they are shaken. They have dis on their attacks
     and spell casters have to make a DC 13 spell casting check or they can't get their spell
     off. If they fail by more than 5, attacks have advantage on them.

- Round 3:

   - Lair actions: Int save DC 13 as they see hoards of enemies rise from the fog. On a fail,
     they are caught in the illusion. They can expend their attack to fight the enemies off or
     they will take 2d6 psych damage. If they fail by more than 5, they take 1d6 damage even if
     they fight and 3d6 if they don't.

- Round 4:

## Revelation List: Lore of Alyxian

- History of the Jewel of Three Prayers.
- The Jewel of Three Prayers was empowered by the gods three times.
- Shrines were erected near each location where the Jewel was empowered.
- The Jewel can be fully reactivated by visiting the shrines.
- Ruidium is appearing in sites associated with the Apotheon.
- Properties of ruidium.
- The Lore of the Alyxian
- Alyxian's Sacrifices:
When Alyxian prayed to Sehanine, he gave up his future
When he prayed to Avandra in Betrayer's Rise, he gave up his present
When he and his followers left Wildemount to help in Marquet, giving up his past


## CORE STRUCTURE of Call of the Netherdeep

  In Ank’harel there are three factions — the Allegiance of Allsight, the Consortium of
  Vermilion Dreams, and the Library of the Cobalt Soul.

  Each faction has a specific ruidium agenda regarding ruidium. (The Allegiance wants to use it
  to become arms dealers; the Consortium wants to monopolize it for arcane research; the
  Library wants it destroyed.)

  Each faction has sent a researcher to Bazzoxan — Prolix Yusaf (Allegiance), Aloysia Telfin
  Consortium), and Question (Library).

  The PCs should arrive in Bazzoxan and befriend a researcher (or more than one).

  The PCs will follow the researcher(s) back to Ank’harel and join a faction (or more than one,
  although that probably won’t remain tenable given the factions’ mutually contradictory
  goals).

  The PCs will then perform faction missions, which lead them to Cael Morrow and then the Netherdeep.
