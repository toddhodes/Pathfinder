# Rivals

Rivals oppose whatever players want to do.

What would the rivals do scale:
- Working in partnership with the PCs.
- Convinced the PCs need help even if the PCs won’t let them, thus following the PCs around.
- Independently trying to figure out how to help Alyxian.
- Concluding that this isn’t any of their business and exiting the campaign to go do other things.
- Seizing the Jewel (and possibly trying to kill the PCs) and taking charge
