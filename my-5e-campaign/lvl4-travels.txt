### GM reminder: Revelation List: Campaign Agendas

  What is the Jewel of Three Prayers? Specifically, the PCs should be able to figure out that
  it was empowered by the gods to aid Alyxian three times; that shrines were erected in those
  places; and that they need to find the shrines in order to fully reactivate the Jewel.

  What is ruidium and what should be done with it? This obviously includes the properties of
  ruidium itself, but it should also become clear that ruidium is appearing at sites associated
  with the Apotheon.

  Who is Alyxian the Apotheon? Answering this means piecing together the details of his story
  and framing the ultimate question of the campaign, which is whether he should be helped,
  freed, or destroyed. (You may also discover that understanding what’s at stake if the
  Apotheon is freed is an important and distinct revelation.)

## Research the jewel or the location

 "You must find me! You must bring the Jewel to the Cyst of Avandra!"
  [within Betrayer’s Rise beneath Bazzoxan]

### Jewel

Orc Elder Ushru breakfast at the Unbroken Tusk inn

  "What you have found is a Vestige of Divergence, an enchanted relic from the time of the
  Calamity known as the Jewel of Three Prayers. People do not stumble upon Vestiges without a
  reason.

  "Bazzoxan is a grim town under the control of the Aurora Watch, not a pleasant place to
   visit.  But I was in Bazzoxan once, where the legacy of the Calamity lingers more strongly
   anywhere else in Xhorhas, and I saw this very Jewel depicted on the walls of the Betrayers’
   Rise.  Perhaps you will find answers wth leading experts who congregrate there."

  "There are often leading experts from Ank’harel on field assignment in Bazzoxan.

### Figure

  "journal of one of the explorers who delved too deep and awakened the abyssal gate in
   Bazzoxan. The end of the journal trails off into mad gibberings, but it includes a
   vivid description of a figure that resembles the one you saw in your vision."

### Avandra

  who is?

  the name appears in reference to a Vestige named the Kiss of the Changebringer:
  "Legend holds that Asmodeus stole this amulet from the neck of Avandra and locked it away within
   the vaults of Bazzoxan. In an expedition into the dark fortress's depths, the Kiss of the
   Changebringer was found and claimed by a group of Aurora Watch soldiers

  Location of Cyst of Avandra
  "It is said that during the time of the Calamity, Avandra blessed a site within Bazzoxan; it
   is described in some demonic texts as a “cyst” which blighted that temple of the Betrayers Gods

### Alyxian

  "You are about a day away from Bazzoxan. Full Ruidus happened the night before giving you all
   a sense of unease, especially those of you with faith."

#### RoS Location Notes

 When Perigee did her final strike against the Betrayer general, she damaged the surroundings
 and weakened the barrier between the material realm and the Abyss.
 the Abyssal rift in Betrayers' Rise has never fully closed, and are a hot-spot for demons.
 Aurora Watch patrols check often and try to keep the demon numbers down.

#### Encounter

  "Rising up before you is the old crest of a ruined citadel, walls tumbled down and cracked.
   You hear scraping rock, low guttural exhortions, and cries of combat."

- 6 Aurora Watch (AW) is already fighting some unusually high level demons
  - 2/6 are down (bleed out in 2 turns if nothing is done)
- fighting a Hezrou and a Draegloth, with a hidden Babau using its Gaze.

- Round 1:

   - Lair actions: The PCs make a Cha save DC 13. On fail, they take 2d6 necro as hands from
     the fog suck the life from them (this cuts through temp hp). Half on a save. Fail by more
     than 5, their max hp is reduced.

- Round 2: 1 Draegloth and 4 Wretched.

   - Lair actions: Wis save DC 13 as they are wracked by sorrow. On fail, uncontrollable
     tears fall; their speed is cut in half and they are shaken. They have dis on their attacks
     and spell casters have to make a DC 13 spell casting check or they can't get their spell
     off. If they fail by more than 5, attacks have advantage on them.

- Round 3:

   - Lair actions: Int save DC 13 as they see hoards of enemies rise from the fog. On a fail,
     they are caught in the illusion. They can expend their attack to fight the enemies off or
     they will take 2d6 psych damage. If they fail by more than 5, they take 1d6 damage even if
     they fight and 3d6 if they don't.

# Canonical Order of Events

Alyxian gained a group of companions during his earlier battles on Wildemount, after he had
gained some fame in battle, after he got the first god blessing. They were an effective and
close unit and were key to taking the area around Bazzoxan, cutting it off from Ghor Dranas.
The scene from the fallen Change Bringer temple happens during this time.

The companions all died during the siege of Ghor Dranas, falling at key moments, heroically, at
times when Alyxian couldn't get to them. During the final battle before taking Ghor Dranas, at
a decisive moment, Alyxian desperately called out to the Moon Weaver for help, and Perigee
came. With her help, they took Ghor Dranas.

Next, the they tackled shutting down Bazzoxan, for though they taken the surrounding area, the
temple still was spitting out demons and causing trouble. Alyxian, along with Perigee, led
groups into the temple, taking sections of it from the demons, driving them back toward the
source. She and Alyxian became close allies during this, with Alyxian finding a sort of comfort
in having a companion so close to the divinity he was taking more and more steps towards and
someone that surely couldn't be killed, seeing as they were immortal (he had hopes, you guys).

With Bazzoxan coming closer to being truly defeated, the Betrayer Gods sent forces to divert
the attention of those attacking the temple. Perigee was needed to defend their allies outside
the temple, with Alyxian continuing efforts inside. Near the end of the long slog, with both
sides becoming desperate, hoards of enemies were thrown at Bazzoxan's defense. With Perigee
desperately close to being over run, Alyxian was called from the assault within to help her,
dooming the allies that he had been fighting with. Alyxian arrived at the battle outside
Bazzoxan, fought through enemies to get Perigee's side, only to see her make a final strike
against the Betrayer general leading the strike, killing her foe and dying herself. With the
general down, the attackers scattered, and a mournful Alyxian finally drove out the demons and
took the temple of Bazzoxan. The scene from the Changer Bringer shrine happens here, as Alyxian
receives the second god blessing.

In the final few battles that Alyxian fights on Wildemount, he fights separated from his mortal
allies. He is only partnered with the humanoid forms of the Moon Weaver and the Changer
Bringer. Cue the carving from the beginning of the Betrayers' Rise.

With Wildemount decimated but Betrayer God strongholds destroyed, Alyxian travels to Marquet,
where the fighting is still going strong. He is perpetually melancholy but still kind, though
he makes no deep connections with those he fights with, staying aloof and full of prayer. He is
fully the Apotheon.

## Revelation List: Lore of Alyxian

- History of the Jewel of Three Prayers.
- The Jewel of Three Prayers was empowered by the gods three times.
- Shrines were erected near each location where the Jewel was empowered.
- The Jewel can be fully reactivated by visiting the shrines.
- Ruidium is appearing in sites associated with the Apotheon.
- Properties of ruidium.
- The Lore of the Alyxian
- Alyxian's Sacrifices:

When Alyxian prayed to Sehanine, he gave up his future, and any chance he had of trying to make
a normal life for himself. In return he received the first part of the Jewel of Three Prayers,
as well as an ally to help him in his struggles (Perigee). With this he was able to help
Sehanine and Moradin trap Torog.

When he prayed to Avandra in Betrayer's Rise, he gave up his present, sacrificing his strongest
ally and only friend, Perigee (I am planning to run the Ruins of Sorrow encounter for some
exposition on Perigee). In return he was given the second part of the Jewel, and was able to
help banish Tharizdun back into the Abyss.

When he and his followers left Wildemount to help in Marquet, he prayed to Correllon, this time
giving up his past, condemning his name and deeds to be lost to history in exchange for the
third part of the Jewel, allowing him to help Corellon defeat Gruumsh.


## CORE STRUCTURE of Call of the Netherdeep

  In Ank’harel there are three factions — the Allegiance of Allsight, the Consortium of
  Vermilion Dreams, and the Library of the Cobalt Soul.

  Each faction has a specific ruidium agenda regarding ruidium. (The Allegiance wants to use it
  to become arms dealers; the Consortium wants to monopolize it for arcane research; the
  Library wants it destroyed.)

  Each faction has sent a researcher to Bazzoxan — Prolix Yusaf (Allegiance), Aloysia Telfin
  Consortium), and Question (Library).

  The PCs should arrive in Bazzoxan and befriend a researcher (or more than one).

  The PCs will follow the researcher(s) back to Ank’harel and join a faction (or more than one,
  although that probably won’t remain tenable given the factions’ mutually contradictory
  goals).

  The PCs will then perform faction missions, which lead them to Cael Morrow and then the Netherdeep.
