- or this hook:

Daybreak comes with a knock on the door of your room. The voice of Orc Elder Ushru comes through the door. 
Ushru invites the characters for breakfast at the Unbroken Tusk inn. At first he is
conversational with the characters, but then his tone becomes deadly serious:

  "A vision came to me last night. A golden amulet rose to the surface of a pool of blood, and
  countless hands lunged upward out of the blood to grasp it. In turn, all the hands fell back
  into the pool until only one remained. The one whose hand claimed the amulet was a handsome
  man with curly hair and a somber expression. He turned to me and said, 'They must find me.
  The ones from the grotto.' Tell me, did anything happen to you in that place that would help
  me understand this vision?"

<expect response>

  "If what you tell me is true, what you have found is a Vestige of Divergence, an
  enchanted relic from the time of the Calamity known as the Jewel of Three Prayers. People do
  not stumble upon Vestiges without a reason.

  "Bazzoxan is a grim town under the control of the Aurora Watch, not a pleasant place to
   visit.  But I was in Bazzoxan once, where the legacy of the Calamity lingers more strongly
   anywhere else in Xhorhas, and I saw this very Jewel depicted on the walls of the Betrayers’
   Rise.  Perhaps you will find answers wth leading experts who congregrate there."


TODO seed other hook:
- leading experts on this from Ank’harel.  Recent reports suggest that they’re on a
  field assignment in Bazzoxan.
- a journal of one of the explorers who delved too deep and awakened the abyssal gate in
  Bazzoxan. The end of the journal trails off into mad gibberings, but it includes a
  vivid description of a figure that resembles the one you saw in your vision.

# Rivals

Rivals oppose whatever players want to do.

What would the rivals do scale:
- Working in partnership with the PCs.
- Convinced the PCs need help even if the PCs won’t let them, thus following the PCs around.
- Independently trying to figure out how to help Alyxian.
- Concluding that this isn’t any of their business and exiting the campaign to go do other things.
- Seizing the Jewel (and possibly trying to kill the PCs) and taking charge
