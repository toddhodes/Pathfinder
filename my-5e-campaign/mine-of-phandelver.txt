# Leaving Cragmaw Hideout

Sildar:

- need to get to Phandelver to give reward

- exiles located the entrance to long-lost Wave Echo Cave, site of the mines of the Phandelver's Pact. 
  they are led by the Rockseekers (Gundren, Tharden, and Nundro).

 "Ages ago, local clans made an agreement known as the Phandelver's Pact, by which they would
  share a rich mine in a wondrous cavern known as Wave Echo Cave. In addition to its mineral
  wealth, the mine contained great magical power.  Spellcasters channeled and bound energy into
  ley lines, centered on a great forge called the Forge of Spells, where great magic could be crafted.

  In time, the calamity swept through Krynn and laid waste to all of history.  The location of Wave Echo Cave was lost."

- Gundren has a map showing the secret location of Wave Echo Cave -> Cragmaw Castle

- Sildar heard from the goblins that Klarg was sent word by the Black Spider the dwarf was to be brought to him.

- An old friend of ours -- human spellcaster named Ilarno [Albrek] -- was in the first wave of Zadash monster pit massacre  
  exiles that traveled to the town months ago.

 "A light rain dampens the rolling plains as you travel north. Around midday, you break
  for lunch under a lonely tree. There, the rogue finds a small rock that looks like a
  grinning face, but otherwise you see nothing out of the ordinary."


## Stonehill Inn

### Milf

a kobold covered in undersized, home-spun gear approaches you, tentatively.  he smells of pets/dander.
- staff with a live scorpion secured to the tip, stinger end pointed out
- flail w/ a glass jar of hornets 
- wooden cage with live giant centipede, which seems oddly aware of you and listening in

"hi!  i'm milf -- you know, like milk, but more fuckable!

 have you heard of my father, Spurt? a great inventor like me! in tal'dorei.  
 Spurt did important things!"

 if not him, how about my brother Spork?

 no?  

 well.... i'm not like them.  it's weird, I'm a human!"

points to Rumble -- I'm a human like you!

disagrees when told, not human -- confused -- "yes, yes you are"

"your a human on your... insides? sorry, milf isn't very smart, i can't really explain it well"

asks someone else -- are you my uncle?  agrees they definitely are.

half crouches down to feign sitting, as there is no chair for him to join,
smiles a meek smile, sips something from a tin cup

## Old Owl Well
  Recently, prospectors in the area have noted that someone has set up a campsite at Old Owl Well,
  and that undead guardians have been posted to keep intruders out.

  - all characters smell a deathly odor wafting from the tower's direction
  - "As you crest a low ridge, you spy the crumbling ruins of an old watchtower standing amid the
     rugged hills. The place is so old that the walls are only mounds of rubble enclosing a courtyard
     of sorts, adjacent to the broken stump of an old tower. A colorful tent has been set up in the
     middle of the courtyard, but no one is in sight."
  - Hamun Kost, the evil mage, emerges from his tent and asks, "What is the meaning of this?"
  - wants to ask Agatha: "What is the name of the wizard who built the tower at Old Owl Well?" [Arthindol]

## Ruins of Thundertree

 "Gradually, the trail becomes an old, overgrown lane winding between dilapidated buildings
  choked in vines and brush. Ahead of you, in the middle of the settlement, rises a steep hill,
  upon which stands a stone tower with a partially collapsed roof and an adjoining cottage. A dirt
  road hugs the base of the hill and wends its way between old stone houses, many of which are
  roofless ruins with interiors open to the weather. Other buildings appear more or less intact.
  The whole place is eerily silent.
  A wooden sign is nailed to a post nearby. It reads: "DANGER! Plant monsters AND zombies! Turn back now!"

 Dragon's Tower: Venomfang: "Another band sent by a 'kindly druid'? What lies did that thing tell you? 
     That I am vile and a threat? Who do I threaten here in my home? The cerature is playing you for fools."

# Finale

Through canny execution and a bit of luck, you have 
- defeated the Black Spider & his legion of minons,
- cleared the Redbrand ruffian bandits, 
- taken a dent out of the Cragmaw clan connected to him.

Once a promising member of the Zadash outcasts who survived the monster pit massacre, is now a corpse.

you have claimed the Pact of the Lost Mine of Phandelver,
- it's Forge of Spells,
- and Wave Echo Cave surrounding it

Phandalin in not clear of all its many challenges, but, much has been set right.

What lies ahead? Weeks or months needed to restore the mines,
months or years needed to master the magic infusions and transfers of the Forge,
a lifetime to undertand its connection to the Portal System.    ["Sigil"]

the Phandelver's Pact has the potential to bring great riches to all who support it, and help
establish a beachhead of peace and prosperity in the area otherwise only famous for terrible battles in a
terrible war.  

Gundren and Nundro Rockseeker agree to take over administration of the mine.  You now set off to finalize
the paperwork on the agreement due for your service, the award of a 10 percent share of the mine's profits.


## Finale in Phandalin

### Papers

Arriving in the Townmaster's Hall, you greet [Harbin Wester], 
Townmaster and Sherriff of Phandalin, and ex-pat aquaintence [Sildar Hallwinter].
- after papers are in order, he remarks:
  you are welcome to make a home here -- perhaps restoring Tresendar Manor for use when you are not
  at the Cave, or otherwise out in search of new adventures.


### Party

a crowd gathers at the Stonehill Inn

At first site of your return to the city, it seems an impromptu party has been set up at the Inn.

Toblen Stonehill, Elmar, Linene, Sister Garaele, the Eldermaths, and the Alderleafs.
and Ayo, Irvan Wastewalker, Maggie, and Dermot.

Irvan (Irwin) is already quite drunk, and pawing on Ajo, a wide smile across his face.

Linene takes out a lute and invites Rumble into a Bugbear jig in 5/4 time, one he knows from... somewhere.
You ask to borrow the instrument, and as you play, you are visited by a vision, and a name,
The Lute of the Beacon.


### Later in the night

later, after the party and cheer, the party is approached by Maggie
guarded, lowered eye contact.

"Dermot, we've had our fun.  Show them"

Dermot shakily produces a crisp parchment: Outsiders are Pilfering our Legacy!
Information on them will be rewarded.  Wanted dead or alive. 

and it has your names and pictures.
information it seems it would haven been difficult to extract unless from a Phandalin-ite or
close associates.

"My take is you best steer clear of this area for a minute, stay in your mine, 
 or take a chance to visit elsewhere.  Let us try and track this down."
