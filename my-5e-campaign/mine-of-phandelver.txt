Lost Mines of Phandelver			
------------------------

# Leaving Cragmaw Hideout

Sildar:

- need to get to Phandelver to give reward

- exiles located the entrance to long-lost Wave Echo Cave, site of the mines of the Phandelver's Pact. 
  they are led by the Rockseekers (Gundren, Tharden, and Nundro).

 "Ages ago, local clans made an agreement known as the Phandelver's Pact, by which they would
  share a rich mine in a wondrous cavern known as Wave Echo Cave. In addition to its mineral
  wealth, the mine contained great magical power.  Spellcasters channeled and bound energy into
  ley lines, centered on a great forge called the Forge of Spells, where great magic could be crafted.

  In time, the calamity swept through Krynn and laid waste to all of history.  The location of Wave Echo Cave was lost."

- Gundren has a map showing the secret location of Wave Echo Cave -> Cragmaw Castle

- Sildar heard from the goblins that Klarg was sent word by the Black Spider the dwarf was to be brought to him.

- An old friend of ours -- human spellcaster named Ilarno [Albrek] -- was in the first wave of Zadash monster pit massacre  
  exiles that traveled to the town months ago.

  --> Overland Travel

 "A light rain dampens the rolling plains as you travel north. Around midday, you break
  for lunch under a lonely tree. There, the rogue finds a small rock that looks like a
  grinning face, but otherwise you see nothing out of the ordinary."


## Stonehill Inn

### Milf

a kobold covered in undersized, home-spun gear approaches you, tentatively.  he smells of pets/dander.
- staff with a live scorpion secured to the tip, stinger end pointed out
- flail w/ a glass jar of hornets 
- wooden cage with live giant centipede, which seems oddly aware of you and listening in

"hi!  i'm milf -- you know, like milk, but more fuckable!

 have you heard of my father, Spurt? a great inventor like me! in tal'dorei.  
 Spurt did important things!"

 if not him, how about my brother Spork?

 no?  

 well.... i'm not like them.  it's weird, I'm a human!"

points to Rumble -- I'm a human like you!

disagrees when told, not human -- confused -- "yes, yes you are"

"your a human on your... insides? sorry, milf isn't very smart, i can't really explain it well"

asks someone else -- are you my uncle?  agrees they definitely are.

half crouches down to feign sitting, as there is no chair for him to join,
smiles a meek smile, sips something from a tin cup
