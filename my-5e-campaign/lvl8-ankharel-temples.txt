Boughs of the Wildmother
Park of Serataani (Melora) in Ank’Harel. Located near the Crystal Chateau in the Sigil District

Description

A large sycamore grows over this park offering shade to those who visit during the day. A wild sort of magic lingers here, cleansing the air and allowing for brief moments of peace amongst nature in the bustle of the city, though sometimes park visitors report strange occurrences such as illusory flower petals, odd creatures, arcane explosions (though usually attributed to Crystal Chateau students), and even a possible ghost.

The Celestial Terrace
Gardens of Sehanine in Ank’Harel. Located along the southern cliffs of the Guided District

Description

A large terrace with pavilions draped in dark blue silk, from where visitors can enjoy the beautiful views of the city and the night sky. The terrace is adorned with statues and sculptures depicting Sehanine and her followers that seem to shift depending on the perspective they’re viewed from.

A large expanse of gardens makes up much of the rest of the terrace and is a favorite spot for lovers and courting couples looking for seclusion in the busting city. Visitors can wander through a maze of seemingly never-ending paths, surrounded by beautiful visions of lush foliage, draping jasmines, flowering mesquite, acacias and other desert flora, magically enhanced with illusions and ever blooming, to the collection of small open-air pavilions that serve as shrines, and places of relaxation.

Those that spend the night amongst the boughs and under the stars may receive the benefit of +1d4 on Charisma skill checks they make the next day.

Temple goers

The Challenge Stone
Arena of Kord in Ank’Harel. Located along the eastern cliffs of the Ridge District

Description

The Challenge Stone is a large forking and cracked stone pillar carved from an ancient meteorite that struck the area during Calamity times. It sits at the center of the shrine, which, unlike many of the other temples in the city of Ank’Harel, is located along the eastern cliffs of the Ridge amidst warehouses and other industry.

The Challenge Stone is a sacred place, where warriors and fighters can prove their strength, courage, and honor in a fair and honorable way. The duels held at the Challenge Stone are seen as a way to resolve disputes without resorting to deadly violence. During duels, the stone glows with an internal fierce blue light and crackles with energy, as if it were struck by lightning, and remains until the conflict is settled.

It is not only a proving ground of battle, but a place where those looking to speak their truth can come to speak out against injustices or give light to their personal struggles. Kord rewards bravery over all, and he recognizes not every fight in one’s life is one fought with weapons.

Temple goers

Dronash Edgejumper - Male Orc. Frequent combatant at the Stone. Obsessed with proving to Kord that he still possesses courage.

Irial West-of-the-Mountain - Female Tabaxi Rogue. Champion of the Bowl of Judgement, abuse survivor, and Truthspeaker of the Challenge Stone.

Crossings of Eventide
Necropolis of the Duskmaven (The Raven Queen) in Ank’Harel. Located in the northern cliffs of the Guided District

Description

Over two hundred feet high, the Crossings of Eventide are a series of tombs carved into the cliffs that border the Guided District. Reliefs depicting the most important deeds of the tombs’ occupants adorn the spaces between the stone slabs that seal the graves. At sunset, crystal braziers that hang throughout the necropolis catch the fading light, painting the nearby cliffside in vibrant hues of pink, orange, and purple.

At the base of the cliff rests a small temple dedicated to the Matron of Death. In Ank’Harel (and in much of Marquet at large), the god of death and fate is perceived differently from how she is regarded in the lands of Wilde mount, Tal’Dorei, and Issylra. Bereft of her moniker “the Raven Queen,” here the god is associated with twilight, inevitability, and the passage of time, and she presides over the transition between life and death. Some Marquesian sects refer to her as the “Duskmaven,” portraying her as a keen-eyed vulture with a golden funerary mask and feathers whose colors range from sunset hues to midnight black.

The interior of the temple is carved from black marble, and reflects shards of colorful light that filter in from stained-glass windows that arch overhead. Deep within the cliffs lies a room which houses a deep cupped pool of blood surrounded by intricate, abstract carvings, and serves as a conduit to communing with the goddess.

Temple goers

Isinia Zeria - Female Half-elf Cleric of the Duskmaven, wears a white porcelain mask, and has long black hair kept in intricately twisted decrative loops.

Dawnshard
Temple of Pelor in Ank’Harel. Located at the northern tip of the Guided District

Description

When the temple was founded, during the early days of Ank’Harel’s existence, foundations were laid in the location where sun would first hit the city as it rose over the morning horizon. Over the centuries since, that location has shifted slightly, but the Dawnshard temple complex has only expanded to follow the light, and now makes up several city blocks at the northernmost tip of the Guided District.

Dawnshard is constructed of white marble imported from the giant mines of the Aggrad Mountains to the north, and its walls are adorned with intricate mosaics depicting scenes of bountiful harvests and the radiant sun. The central dome of the temple is made of gold and glass, allowing the light of the sun to shine down upon the altar. The air inside is always filled with the spiced scent of incense and sandalwood.

Each year, during Highsummer, people in Ank’Harel launch lanterns into the sky as the sun rises over Dawnshard. The tradition started in Aeshanadoor, but was quickly adopted and spread through much of Marquet. In Ank’Harel, the lanterns are usually enhanced with brumstone and in recent years even mimic the skyships of the Alsfarin Union – much to the consternation of the devout, who don’t enjoy seeing the commodification of the holiday.

The Inception Altar
Small shrine to Moradin in Ank’Harel. Located in the north-central part of the Guided District

Description

An altar of chiseled obsidian, framed in gold inlaid with dwarven inscription, and set with rubies is said to have the power to imbue the creations made by the skilled blacksmiths and artisans of the temple with special properties and blessings. A gift to J’mon Sa Ord for the city of Ank’Harel, given by Ironkeeper Shirash Greyspine of Kraghammer in 621 PD.

Moradin is not commonly worshiped in the city by the general populace, but many of Ank’Harel’s talented craftspeople sometimes visit with their latest inventions, hoping for blessings.

Halls of Argentum
Temple of Bahamut in Ank’Harel. Located across from the Blessing Well

Description

The temple is comprised of five large halls that join at the center where an enormous statue of Bahamut made of pure platinum rests. The statue was commissioned by J’mon Sa Ord from the skilled metalworkers and artisans of Draconia before it fell. The central chamber of the temple is a grand hall with a high ceiling, adorned with intricate murals inlaid with cast off dragonscales that depict Bahamut’s long battle with Tiamat during the Calamity.

Crypts beneath the temple house bodies of devout that have made the pilgrimage to one of the oldest sites of Bahamut’s worship still standing outside of Vasselheim.

The temple is tended to by a group of primarily dragonborn priests, acolytes, and paladins, who are known for their adherence to the principles of honor and justice. They are often seen performing daily rituals and ceremonies at the altar that rests between the Platinum Dragon’s feet, as well as providing guidance and counsel to those visiting.

Temple goers

Highbearer Siuan Silverwing - Female Silver Dragonborn. Originally from a small fishing village on the coast in Aeshanadoor.

House of Revival
Shrine to the Dawnflower (Sarenrae) in Ank'Harel. Located near the central park of the Guided District

Description
The House of Revival, established only in the last few years since the Dawnflower’s recent rise in popularity, is a small, charming building of cream marble and gold accents. The interior walls are painted in warm colors, and the floor is covered with a soft, plush red carpet. The air is scented with incense and the faint aroma of honeysuckle.

To the left of the entrance, is a small pool of crystal-clear water that almost seems to glow with a gentle light. The pool is shaped like a blooming flower, with delicate petals carved of white marble. On the right side of the room is an abstractly carved depiction of a phoenix that holds an ever burning flame between two outstretched wings.

Priests of the temple say that if one is looking for atonement, one needs only to gaze into the fire, and she will burn away the past and leave you renewed. One of the few places in the city where resurrection is an openly available service, though pricey.

Temple goers
Firekeeper Sheila Sareddon - Female human priestess in her mid-70s. Helped establish the Temple of Renewal in Vasselheim with Pike Trickfoot twenty-five years earlier, and moved to Ank’Harel a few years back hoping that the heat of the desert would warm her aching bones. Since then, she’s spread the word of the goddess, and has acquired a small, but devout group of worshipers.

Path of Prosperity
Shrine to She-Who-Makes-the-Path (Avandra) in Ank’Harel. Located along the eastern hills of the Guided District

Description

The Path of Prosperity is a winding path that goes through the site, starting at the gated entrance and leading to the shrine at the end, which is carved into a large boulder and contains a bronze relief of Avandra, her face turned to one side and with a flowing headscarf made from cloth-of-gold. The cobbled path is made with a beautiful medley of intricate tiles, carved stones, shards of ceramics, metal plates, and inscriptions brought by wanderers and supplicants as offerings, and there are several benches and resting areas along the way for visitors to take a break and reflect on their own personal journeys.

Along the Path is a set of markers and signs that indicate the distance to different cities and landmarks, both within the city and as far away as Wildemount and Tal’Dorei. Small piles of carefully balanced coins surround these markers as offerings.

Temple goers

Sa’adah - Female Orc with golden skin, sorcerer, chosen of Avandra, and companion of Alyxian the Apotheon during his battles in Marquet. Given the gift of partial immortality by her goddess for her service, but cursed during her battles by Zehir with a wasting disease, she wanders Ank’Harel and the surrounding areas in a sort of limbo in the hopes of finding some sign of Alyxian, or adventurers who share some piece of his fierce spirit. Known to modern day Marquesians as the semi-mythical figure, She-Who-Walks-The-Path. She appears to travelers who aren’t sure of their destination, and walks alongside them hearing their stories until they’ve arrived to the destination they most need to find, sometimes bending time and space to do so.

Sanctum Harmonium
Temple of Erathis in Ank’Harel. Located in the central part of the Guided District close to the main road.

Description

A large series of connected domes form the main structure of the temple. In the entry hall is an enormous set of scales enchanted to move as a representation of Exandria’s current balance between civilization and chaos. The scales, gently tipped towards civilization, have not moved more than a few millimeters in several years, but some Heralds, claiming increased activity from various cults and nefarious organizations, believe there is a shift coming soon, and measure the meters to center as a monthly posted bulletin, much to the alarm of concerned citizens.

One of the largest places of worship in the city after the Dawnshard, the Sanctum Harmonium mainly serves as the location of the main civil court systems of Ank’Harel as well as a refuge and stopover for those in need, who are provided meals and lodgings free of charge.

Temple goers

Knight Commander Priti Chadha - Female Human. High steward of the Sanctum Harmonium, only recently promoted, and very intent on “cleaning up” the way the temple is run to fit her own view on Erathis’ ideal of justice.

Lawmaster Kibwe Barrelhand - Male Half-orc. Presides over the Third District Sandstone court. Well regarded and fair. Has a large family that lives in the River District.

Starsilver Halls
Temple of Corellon in Ank’Harel. Located in the central part of the Guided District

Description

The temple is known for its simple serenity. The temple features walls inlaid with a rare metal colloquially called starsilver, which glows with a soft, ethereal light imbued by brumestone crystals contained within the silver.

The central chamber of the temple is a small hall with a high ceiling, adorned with a beautiful mural of the night sky, and a small altar in the center. The temple also serves as a resource for the study and practice of magic and the arts, offering classes and workshops to those who wish to learn and cannot afford higher education.

Temple goers

Mystic Zakiah Ifeanyi - Male Air Genasi. As a young child he was brought in when he started exhibiting sparks of power, and never ended up leaving. He now runs testing and training programs for disadvantaged youths with a magical spark in Ank’Harel.
