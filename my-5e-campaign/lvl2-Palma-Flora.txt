What Three Earrings Knows

The tabaxi captain knows exactly what happened in Palma Flora, thanks to the Revelry
spies that have been observing the village and the Sharkfeather Abyss for the past few
months. She reveals any of the following information:

  - The earthquake dragged Flora Isle into the Sharkfeather Abyss, a nearby trench that
  is home to a clan of shark-herding humanoids known as sahuagin.

  - The Sharkfeather sahuagin and the people of Palma Flora have been at odds for
  generations, since Palma Flora hosts an annual shark-hunting festival.

  - A young female sahuagin named Selachai recently took charge of the Sharkfeather clan
  and wields unusual powers. She carries a magic scepter that has been recognized as a
  rod of retribution, which has become a conduit for unearthly levels of magical power.

  - No one knows exactly how this young sahuagin managed to cause an earthquake.
  What is important is finding a way to delve beneath those waves and take the scepter.

  - Any number of nearby ports/islands are good sites for Wavechaser to dock, unload
  its refugees, and find gear. eg Port Damali
