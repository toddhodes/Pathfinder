### Refugees

  "Island refugees have created makeshift shelters from the sun all across the deck of
   Wavechaser. Those you saved during the raid are here, as well as a handful of others who
   managed to reach the ship before it left the dock.

  One of the villagers aided shows their gratitude with gift of family-heirloom golden bracelet (worth 25 gp).

  want to be dropped at various destinations

### Crew

choose an island

Tower of Storms (from DoIP, Dragon of Icespire Peak)
- lighthouse is built atop a barren, 80-foot-high outcropping of rock. At low tide, there might be a narrow causeway 
- there is something deeply wrong w/ the place, thew light itself is evil
- "on the coast is an old stone lighthouse. Ships are drawn to this gleaming tower like moths
   to a flame, and are doomed to crash upon its rocks. Their wrecks must be filled with treasure!"


### Captain


  Roll Persuation. 
  DC high: if claim reverly, admit spies
  DC any: 

  Roll Wisdom (Insight), Bobby w/ ADV 
  DC 16: visits at night

  The tabaxi captain knows exactly what happened in Palma Flora, thanks to the Revelry spies
  that have been observing the village and the Sharkfeather Abyss for the past few months. She
  reveals any of the following information:

  - The earthquake dragged Flora Isle into the Sharkfeather Abyss, a nearby trench that
  is home to a clan of shark-herding humanoids known as sahuagin.

  - The Sharkfeather sahuagin and the people of Palma Flora have been at odds for
  generations, since Palma Flora hosts an annual shark-hunting festival.

  - A young female sahuagin named Selachai recently took charge of the Sharkfeather clan
  and wields unusual powers. She carries a magic scepter that has been recognized as a
  rod of retribution, which has become a conduit for unearthly levels of magical power.

  - No one knows exactly how this young sahuagin managed to cause an earthquake.
  What is important is finding a way to delve beneath those waves and take the scepter.

  - Any number of nearby ports/islands are good sites for Wavechaser to dock, unload
  its refugees, and find gear.


## Ports

- Bisaft Isle. This tiny island has a small port. A shaman living in the hills beyond the
  port might be able to provide the characters with a charm of water breathing 
- Brokenbank. apothecary potions to breathe underwater.
- Port Damali. experimental diving helmets
