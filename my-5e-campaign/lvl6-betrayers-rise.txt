## Approach Betrayer's Rise

  **Aloysia**·
  - wants to find an ancient rift deep inside the Betrayers' Rise.  [prayer site?]
  - The Dreamer is exploring the Netherdeep in search of a portal, which he believes will lead him to the surface of Ruidus

  **Question**
   - rubbing of a wall carving in the Betrayers' Rise (R1).  symbol that depicts a long-haired woman peering into the distance.
     DC 12 (Religion): holy symbol of Avandra the Change Bringer.

  Its exterior is in a wide variety of styles from various locations or planes or Gods; these
  include many potential entrances, or study locations, tho these are mostly inaccessible due
  to inscrutible entrance instructions, runes to be interpreted, and likely traps to be
  navigated.

Many entrances;
ruidium is specifically found around this entrance and in this micro-dungeon
find this one, or, get a guide to the bas relief, or, steal notes to it.

"The Doors of The Laughing Hand, champion of Torog. Speak, friend, and enter."

- Betrayer's Rise is an ancient palace of the Princes of the Abyss:
  Orcus: Demon Prince of the Undead; domain: Thanatos
  Yeenoghu: A demon lord of hunger and destruction, God of the gnolls; domain: Death Dells
  Graz'zt: Demon Prince of Indulgence; domain: Azzatar
  Baphomet: The Horned King, Demon Prince of Beasts; domain: The Endless Maze
  Lolth: Spider queen, god of the (underground) drow; domain: The Demonweb, aka the Dreadnest


## Enter the Rise

You stand on a weather- and time- stained bridge that extends over a chasm of swirling silver mist. On the far side
of the bridge is a closed double door of black stone inscribed with a circle containing the profile of a smiling
woman. The symbol is gouged with deep marks.  As you get within 20', the double door begins to radiate faint crimson
light. The light slowly pulses, as if beckoning you to touch it. The Jewel of Three Prayers grows warm to the touch
and pulses in sync with the glowing door.

The AW warily watch you enter, and close the doors behind you.  darkness, as the last beam of sunlight shrinks away.

## Rooms



## Custom Rooms

From the entrance the tunnel is steadily ascending pathway, 19-foot high, six feet wide.  After 200'
the tunnel turns sharply left, and then right.  another 100', same.
after a quarter mile, you hear an faint series of tones.  after another quarter mile, they become inaudible.
after a mile, the walls stop, and it opens into a chamber + larger cylindrical tunnel, 40 feet in diameter, going to
the left and right.  The left passageway is fully caved in and collapsed. The right tunnel continues to drop down.
Eventually on the right side of the tunnel, there is an four sided needle like obelisk that emerges from the ground,
rising up about 15 feet. The tunnel continues before it slopes further down.

The obelisk is slate gray off color with vertical abyssal symbols on each side.  

On the right side of the Obelisk is a set of stone doors with two figures, one on each door, beautiful
obsidian (alabaster), humanoid features, smooth skin, cropped hair, folded wings on their back, robes, 
blank expressions. There are trails of crimson down their faces.

The doors lead to a subterranean courtyard.

The subterranean courtyard has a crescent form with a curved wall, floor-to-ceiling. The ground is uneven with
rocks and scraps of metal. There are a 7 statues, all humanoid, sitting, all facing the far wall. They all are
of white stone, smooth head, cropped hair, folded wings across the back, robes, crystal trails from the eyes, and all
sitting.  Beside the statues there are celestial bodies buried with their armor and weapons.

The far wall is a deep, black stone, with grooves about every ten feet or so that just striate up the side.
There is a single, 20 feet wide, 15 feet tall adamantine door with a yellow gem that is affixed, and a dangling
loose chain in front of it.

pulling the chain opens the door to an interior room. There is a row 2x4 pillars, 60' length, the width unknown
as the light fades to pitch black beyond 20' either side, except for a collapsed corner on the right side at the end.

across the way there is a double doors, and a large gate of intersecting lattice metal bars. there is a keyhole
through which mist is emerging.  the edges of the room are pitch black magical darkness.
 [key hidden in chamber]

Beyond the gate and door is a 10' square room with a descending spiral staircase.
billowing from the staircase is a 1' thick mist that covers the floor. The spiral staircase is three feet wide and spirals down to the right.
 [One of the steps is trapped, triggering a very subtle hum], summoning an Invisible Stalker, and an electrifying wave 
  that periodically fires]

On the bottom of the stairs is a large brass and stone tower with blue and red crystal veins. beside it 
there is a door made with similar material as the tower -- without a handle; there is a small gemstone shaped slot 
encircled by concentric crystal.
 [must put crystal in slot to open]

beyond the door is massive natural cavern at the edge of a dark chasm. 
A heavy iron bridge crosses it, but the other side and the bottom (if any) is lost in darkness. 

120' bridge + 20' approaches.
visible from center: 20' to either side 
stalagmites rise up into 15' platforms w/ 5' rusted iron cages on them. Within the cages are bones and armor.
 [inescapable lash in one]
 [@ 60' 2 ropers attack]
 [at bottom of bridge is a mass of skin, flesh, muscle, teeth, mouths and eyes, that move against itself, writhing and shifting]

 movement down the caverns awakens a chorus of hundreds of whispering, moaning, screaming voices which gradually subside 
 --> DC15 WIll to resist their influence and back away, else... starts to prepare to jump
 loud voice --> whispers rise --> DC15 Cha or roll for effect: 1st: catatonic for six seconds, later: catatonic, walk random direction

after passing through chasm, another massive door.

one single porcelain celestial sculpture, holding its hands together with a small opening. 
 [need item to open; eyes crystalize]
