# Betrayer's Rise

6th	Chpt 3b: Betrayers' Rise (R1-R16)

## Approach Betrayer's Rise

  Aloysia
  - wants to find an ancient rift deep inside the Betrayers' Rise.  [prayer site?]
  - The Dreamer is exploring the Netherdeep in search of a portal, which he believes will lead him to the surface of Ruidus

  Question
   - rubbing of a wall carving in the Betrayers' Rise depicts a long-haired woman
   - searching for lost people

  Its exterior is in a wide variety of styles from various locations or planes or Gods; these
  include many potential entrances, or study locations, tho these are mostly inaccessible due
  to inscrutible entrance instructions, runes to be interpreted, and likely traps to be
  navigated.

"The Doors of The Laughing Hand, champion of Torog. Speak, friend, and enter."

- Betrayer's Rise is an ancient palace of the Princes of the Abyss:
  Orcus: Demon Prince of the Undead; domain: Thanatos
  Yeenoghu: A demon lord of hunger and destruction, God of the gnolls; domain: Death Dells
  Graz'zt: Demon Prince of Indulgence; domain: Azzatar
  Baphomet: The Horned King, Demon Prince of Beasts; domain: The Endless Maze
  Lolth: Spider queen, god of the (underground) drow; domain: The Demonweb, aka the Dreadnest


## Notes

Torog is largely depicted as a swollen, malformed worm slithering through darkness
with a hairless human head, and three arms carving through a lightless rock.
He was defeated during the Calamity by Pelor, the Dawnfather and Sarenrae, the Everlight.

Commandments of the Crawling King
- Seek and exalt places where no light touches.
- Revel in the pain you inflict upon others, and relish the pain you suffer yourself as an offering to the Crawling King.
- Imprison those who cannot resist you, and drag all life into the darkness.

## Enter the Rise

You stand on a weather- and time- stained bridge that extends over a chasm of swirling silver mist. On the far side
of the bridge is a closed double door of black stone inscribed with a circle containing the profile of a smiling
woman. The symbol is gouged with deep marks.  As you get within 20', the double door begins to radiate faint crimson
light. The light slowly pulses, as if beckoning you to touch it. The Jewel of Three Prayers grows warm to the touch
and pulses in sync with the glowing door.

The AW warily watch you enter, and close the doors behind you.  darkness, as the last beam of sunlight shrinks away.

### Vecna's Library

- Book: Disquisitions on the Vicissitude of Avandra
  - Avandra was neither "good" nor "evil"; she broke rules.  She considered betraying the elven pantheon but
    something convinced her otherwise, and she became a godess of change

- Book: The Herald of the Lamented of the Battle for Ghor Dranas
 - covers 4 people; 4 who fell in the Battle for Ghor Dranas + one who was in the fields at the Battle of "the Bazzoxan"

 1. Phaelis - Champion of the Wildmother.  halfling Druid from the area of current-day Lotusden Greenwood.
  Phaelis fell in the Battle for Ghor Dranas.  In memory of Phaelis and as a beacon of hope, the Wildmother
  sprouted the Arbor Exemplar from the remains of his body.

  three artifacts were laid with him in his crypt that was sealed by the gods for his service, but then lost to time
  - The Verdant Heart, a green pendant on a necklace. (1/day wildshape)
  - The Sapling of Rebirth, a staff made from a branch of the Seed of Rebirth in Vasselheim
     +1 quarterstaff, +1 to spell attack rolls and spell DC
  - The Hide of the Feral Guardian (VoD) beautifully detailed leather armor, gift from Melora

  ! explains the ritual to open his crypt (call out to Avandra)

 2. Orrik - Champion of the All-Hammer,
  - He wields a Vestige of Divergence which was forged in the Core Anvil, A hammer called Obsidias.

 3. Duana - Champion of the Dawnfather, elven high priestess (cleric)
  - Wears the VoD, Plate of the Dawnmartyr

 4. Dyamak - Champion of the Knowing Mentor, blue Dragonborn monk
  - Was the owner of VoD, Dyamak’s Wraps.
  - Claims she is the original “Cobalt Soul” monk. As the champion of Ioun, she gathered knowledge and
  tried to stomp out corruption wherever possible. After her passing, the tenets she lived by
  became the basis for the Order of the Cobalt Soul, and the order was named in her honor.

  has long since been forgotten even to those within the order! her spirit lives on, though, through them

  5. Perigee - final granted an ally granted by the Moonweaver


### Zehir (snake) room

Looking at my serpentine greatness, you might wonder, which?
First, set the darkest scales of night
Second, the one that’s not just an itch
Third, trusting the safest of bites
Finally, once you're set, the maw is the switch
Sing my name for an inkling

DC 15:
“Red against yellow, kills a fellow;
 but without color, we can only a guess”

solution
head
Black | Black | Black
body
Yellow | Red | Yellow
tail
Red | Black | Red  OR  Red | Black | Yellow   OR  Yellow | Black | Red


### Fountain of the First Knight

In the center of the room is a basin over which stands a somber statue of man in armor, horns
curled back, wings outstretched, holding a carved stone mace.  The fountain basins hold amber
liquid that sparkles like the depths of the stars.

The statue is of Zerxus Ilerez, First Knight, and Right Hand of the Lord of Hells.

Any player that gazes into the liquid must make a DC 15 Wisdom save or be captivated by the stars and incapacitated for one hour,
gaining one level of exhaustion and temp hitpoints equal to your level.  Taking damage breaks the charm effect.


#### Prayer Site of Avandra

A spectral figure blossoms forth from the amulet. This warrior, who your recognize as Alyxian and from
your previous vision, looks up at you with a faint smile.

"You came... the items, they brought you... I can't believe you found your way here.
 Let me tell you what I can"

The crystals around you glow brightly, and your vision shifts. You see a company of armored
soldiers, Alyxian among them, marching toward the Betrayers' Rise. Their expressions are grim.

Surrounding Alyxian are four figures who converse for a bit, then break off and head south.
a halfling Druid.  an elven high priestess.  a blue Dragonborn monk. a dwarven fighter.
these are the Lamented of the Battle for Ghor Dranas - Phaelis, Duana, Dyamak, Orrik.
according to the book, they are marching to their deaths.

The vision shifts again, and you're in the battle of the barbed fields, the battle for bozoxxon
and betrayer's rise.  Alyxian is hurled across the battlefield by the claws of gorilla-like
demons, and runs to take cover inside the rise.  The scene blurs, and shifts again.

Alyxian is on his knees, before a simple wooden altar that bears a hastily drawn holy symbol of Avandra.
Exhausted, he's lifted to his feet by a young woman with light brown skin and blonde flowing hair;
leather sandals, a simple gold-colored dress, gold bracers, silver jewelry, large Moonweaver earings, and 
armed with a silver mace.

The same woman you saw as the last standing in you visions of the end of the battle of the
barbed fields.  Perigree.

The scenery shifts, and the warrior is now underwater, amid the ruins of a sunken city.
Alyxian turns to face you and falls to his knees. You sense dispair. 

"I beseeched the gods for power three times and three times received it -- first on the shores
 of Wildemount, where you discovered me after eons. Then once again, here, in the depths of
 Betrayers' Rise, where we meet again.  And finally in a temple of Corellon, the Arch Heart, in
 a city of elves and orcs in the jungles of Marquet, a city destroyed centuries ago. 

 These divine gifts transformed me from a mortal being into something more, and had their cost.  
 The first act stole my past, the second stole my present, and the final stole my future.

 Now I remain, long forgotten, imprisoned in an underwater place lit by a crimson glow.
 Mortals are harvesting the source of the glow, and this act is torture, and dangerous.
 It's ripping things apart.  It's the source of the rifts that allowed me to see you, but also,
 sends legions from hell and the abyss into the world."

 While the city of elves and orcs was destroyed centuries ago, it's surroundings remain intact.
 Gruumsh, the Ruiner, attempted to strike the center of the city with a force intended to
 destroy the entire continent. I was able to block him at the last second, and Marquet
 survived, but I and it were permanently changed.

 The jungle is now desert.  But that is something.  Maybe the third prayer site remains there, somewhere."

And with that, as Alyxian trails off, and the vision fades.

You return to reality, where 3 glowing bright angelic figures hover. A sonorous voice addresses you:

"We might be unable to cross the divine gate outselves, but, what Alyxian tells you is true.
 He was our champion, and has been forgotten.  As the holders of our most treasured artifacts,
 we -- Avandra, Corellon, and Sehanine -- ask of you...  Seek out Alyxian, whatever has become
 of him.  Find out what has happened.  In turn, we will provide help as best we can for the
 journey, and be in your debt.  We don't know the state of Alyxian, but, we owe it to him to find out.

 Now, as for the help..."

At this, each of you feels an item on your person being imbued with divine magic.
- For DRU, Adam, and Bobbery, your vestiges of divergance -- the rod, the spear, the jewel.. --
  glow a brightness you haven't seen before.
- For Rumble, Stel, and Feanturi, one item each takes on a shine

And with that:
 **Do you want to attempt to ask anything of Alyxian or the gods?**

 - Fountain of the First Knight
 - Chamber of Tiamat
 - Hall of Mirrors
 - Serpent’s Maw
 - Vecna’s Library

From the entrance the tunnel is steadily ascending pathway, 19-foot high, six feet wide.  After 200'
the tunnel turns sharply left, and then right.  another 100', same.
after a quarter mile, you hear an faint series of tones.  after another quarter mile, they become inaudible.
after a mile, the walls stop, and it opens into a chamber + larger cylindrical tunnel, 40 feet in diameter, going to
the left and right.  The left passageway is fully caved in and collapsed. The right tunnel continues to drop down.
Eventually on the right side of the tunnel, there is an four sided needle like obelisk that emerges from the ground,
rising up about 15 feet. The tunnel continues before it slopes further down.

The obelisk is slate gray off color with vertical abyssal symbols on each side.

On the right side of the Obelisk is a set of stone doors with two figures, one on each door, beautiful
obsidian (alabaster), humanoid features, smooth skin, cropped hair, folded wings on their back, robes,
blank expressions. There are trails of crimson down their faces.

The doors lead to a subterranean courtyard.

The subterranean courtyard has a crescent form with a curved wall, floor-to-ceiling. The ground is uneven with
rocks and scraps of metal. There are a 7 statues, all humanoid, sitting, all facing the far wall. They all are
of white stone, smooth head, cropped hair, folded wings across the back, robes, crystal trails from the eyes, and all
sitting.  Beside the statues there are celestial bodies buried with their armor and weapons.

The far wall is a deep, black stone, with grooves about every ten feet or so that just striate up the side.
There is a single, 20 feet wide, 15 feet tall adamantine door with a yellow gem that is affixed, and a dangling
loose chain in front of it.

pulling the chain opens the door to an interior room. There is a row 2x4 pillars, 60' length, the width unknown
as the light fades to pitch black beyond 20' either side, except for a collapsed corner on the right side at the end.

across the way there is a double doors, and a large gate of intersecting lattice metal bars. there is a keyhole
through which mist is emerging.  the edges of the room are pitch black magical darkness.
 [key hidden in chamber]

Beyond the gate and door is a 10' square room with a descending spiral staircase.
billowing from the staircase is a 1' thick mist that covers the floor. The spiral staircase is three feet wide and spirals down to the right.
 [One of the steps is trapped, triggering a very subtle hum], summoning an Invisible Stalker, and an electrifying wave
  that periodically fires]

On the bottom of the stairs is a large brass and stone tower with blue and red crystal veins. beside it
there is a door made with similar material as the tower -- without a handle; there is a small gemstone shaped slot
encircled by concentric crystal.
 [must put crystal in slot to open]

beyond the door is massive natural cavern at the edge of a dark chasm.
A heavy iron bridge crosses it, but the other side and the bottom (if any) is lost in darkness.

120' bridge + 20' approaches.
visible from center: 20' to either side
stalagmites rise up into 15' platforms w/ 5' rusted iron cages on them. Within the cages are bones and armor.
 [inescapable lash in one]
 [@ 60' 2 ropers attack]
 [at bottom of bridge is a mass of skin, flesh, muscle, teeth, mouths and eyes, that move against itself, writhing and shifting]

 movement down the caverns awakens a chorus of hundreds of whispering, moaning, screaming voices which gradually subside
 --> DC15 WIll to resist their influence and back away, else... starts to prepare to jump
 loud voice --> whispers rise --> DC15 Cha or roll for effect: 1st: catatonic for six seconds, later: catatonic, walk random direction

after passing through chasm, another massive door.

one single porcelain celestial sculpture, holding its hands together with a small opening.
 [need item to open; eyes crystalize]
