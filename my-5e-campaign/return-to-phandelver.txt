## Revisiting Old Owl Well


Sister Garaele quest: 

  The players find out from Agatha that she gave Bowgentle’s Book to a necromancer, Tsernoth,
  about a hundred years ago.  [Hint Hamun Kost is also a necromancer]

  History of the book:

  Tsernoth and apprentice took Bowgentle’s Book and headed to the Phandalin ruin to look for an
  old watchtower, rumoured to contain a cache of magical items. The tower had been built by a
  great Netherese wizard named Arthindol (this is actual lore regarding Old Owl Well).
  Tsernoth was never seen again.

  Hamun Kost’s master, Tsernoth’s apprentice, told Kost about this. Kost has located Old Owl
  Well and wants to confirm it was built by Arthindol (thus his quest for the PCs). He is
  investigating the site, and when sure,


Hamun Kost quest:

  intends to excavate Old Owl Well and discover the fate of Tsernoth, Bowgentle’s Book, and hopefully the
  magical cache of Arthindol.
