"Let the night guide the way" in conversation, in Darktow accented Thieves Cant

## Intro

Rosohna, meaning "Rebirth" in the language of the drow, is a vast metropolis in almost perpetual night, alight with
thousands of small, green, sparkling arcane lanterns. Bonfires are lit in some streets, creating orange glows that
break up the green lights. The city's buildings, some of which are repurposed ruins that have been built upon and
refurbished, are made of stone, metal, and dark clay. Others, especially closer to the center of the city, appear to
be similar to an elvish domicile design that is familiar yet unfamiliar, in some ways slender and jagged, but
beautiful and sleek.  Much of the architecture in Rosohna incorporates the Kryn colors of purple and green.
The extended wards of the city are more patchwork and scattered, progressively wider in shape and more diverse in
population as one travels outward. Each district is surrounded by large 15-foot barriers.


### Sections

- Ghostland: beyond the walls.  incursions of the spirits of the calamity

### Shadowspire + Dungeon of Penance

Under the city is the Shadowshire, a grandiose, subterranean cavern about a quarter mile across in every direction.
The base of the cavern is a "bustling neighborhood of stone and glass, lit with green lantern light." 
It was reclaimed from Torog's prisons during the days of Ghor Dranas and is now home to the poor.
Luminescent crops line the floor and the ceiling of the central cavern, a 
"massive underground farmland maintained through magical means, bearing unique sunless vegetables".
walls contain protruding bits of rough rock, crystals, and an exposed metal ore that glimmers when the light hits it.

- accessed from the Firmaments by a very large stairway spiraling around one of three pillars
- an entrance to the Dungeon of Penance (another entrance is in the Nimbus Keep)

## Three Sun Square

"Hundreds of people flock to Three Sun Square in advance of the Brilliant Night. The crowded plaza is filled with
 colorful stalls and vendors hawking toys and keepsakes. Booths selling steaming rice, tangy stews, and sun- and
 moon- shaped desserts fill the air with delectable fragrances. Nearby, members of the Nightguard -- Empress Leylas
 Krynn's queensguard of the Auroura Watch (led by Dusk Captain Quana Kryn) -- a holy order of protectors -â€” patrol
 the arched balconies of their headquarters, the Noble Jewel, and scan the crowd for trouble."

you can shop or ask around. They pack up and ask to walk you to a house in the Gallimaufry to talk.

after they resolve the stall:

"An ear-splitting crash pierces the air. Five figures wearing snarling, crimson masks clamber atop stalls, each
 raising a cone-like device to their mouth. Along with an irritating buzzing noise, the masked figures' voices
 emanate from the contraptions, amplified over the cacophony of the crowd: 
 'Down with war tyrants! Let the embers light the way!'" 
 "Cast off your fetters!" "Democracy now!"

- The Ashen Heirs decry the AW as oppressive brutes masquerading as pious saints; stop the war, free the captives
- Your the two contacts sigh, might be trouble -- Ashen Heirs
- 5 AW head this way
- DC 16 Wisdom (Perception): intensifying vibration beneath your feet. 
- subsequent DC 14 Intelligence (Nature): something is burrowing under the square.

"Stone cracks and people scream as a massive, spiked worm erupts from the center of the square, catapulting booths
 and handcarts into the air. The monstrosity roars, spraying the scattering crowd with fist-sized globs of spittle.
 Guards shout for reinforcements."
- The AH start to scatter
- 5 AW start to help locals escape

after a few rounds:
- DC 14 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) - Ashen Heirs' devices are irritating the creature
- DC 14 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) - drop their device (AC 13, hp 5)

after 5 rounds:
- Vazda (LG pari) appears + 10 AW (Nightguard)

aftermath: Vazda approaches heal
- A blue-skinned celestial with four scarlet wings lands before you, accompanied by a gentle breeze. 
  wears a pointed, shimmering helmet and wields a flanged mace. "I am Vazda, harbinger of the Nightguard and Xhorhas's righteous hand."
- Vazda offers to heal
- offers 800gp job for a few days -- lead-up to RSun / Brilliant Night, the AW has seen many disruptions. 
  - Rebels and AW members are harmed during altercations. Vazda wants those who oppose BQ's rule to have the opportunity to 
    learn the error of their ways peaceably.
- motions over to 2 AW questioning someone
  "Two AW question a calm light-skinned drow/elf woman with dark hair, sharp green eyes, and a pink tunic over a red dress. 
   One guard and the blue-skinned Vazda lock eyes, and the latter nods. The AW place manacles on the drow."
   he sighs -- "infamous agitator, that one"

"The Queen worries for the safety of her people. Today's incident comes on the heels of an Ashen Heirs assault at
 the Ruz Bazaar, which shows their threat is increasing. We've learned they're seeking magic they can use to disrupt
 the RS/BN. If the Ashen Heirs are left unchecked, I fear the queen will cancel the celebrations and might even impose martial
 law until the rebels' threat is ended. Will you help me prevent this?" (if not, take a look anyway)


## Safehouse

they describe
"The architecture also extends below the ground level; the Dynasty has, over time,
 reclaimed the subterranean halls of Ghor Dranas. Some of the underground structures serve as residential areas, some
 are hubs of the tunnel network the drow use to travel throughout Wildemount, some are used for the farming of edible
 mushrooms, and some remain true to their original purpose as holding cells for dangerous prisoners."

explain that they have an idea -- there is an item, the shard solitaire, that the court is interested in.
we can get you an invite to a party, where you can steal it.  and then you can get a meeting to trade it for your man.
