## Pre-entry hook

Message from 3-Earings Dad, Tybalt Rye: go to the ornamental knife stall in Two Moons Square, in the center of the
celebration in the Firmaments; use the phrase "Let the night guide the way" or "Let the night be our guide" in
conversation, in a Menagerie Coast accent.  Respond to their follow-up query in Thieves Cant.

## Arrival at the city

Rosohna, meaning "Rebirth" in the language of the drow, is a vast metropolis in almost perpetual night, alight with
thousands of small, green, sparkling arcane lanterns. Bonfires are lit in some streets, creating orange glows that
break up the green lights. The city's buildings, some of which are repurposed ruins that have been built upon and
refurbished, are made of stone, metal, and dark clay. Others, especially closer to the center of the city, appear to
be similar to an elvish domicile design that is familiar yet unfamiliar, in some ways slender and jagged, but
beautiful and sleek.  Much of the architecture in Rosohna incorporates the Kryn colors of purple and green.
The extended wards of the city are more patchwork and scattered, progressively wider in shape and more diverse in
population as one travels outward. Each district is surrounded by large 15-foot barriers.

The architecture also extends below the ground level; the Dynasty has, over time, reclaimed the subterranean halls
of Ghor Dranas. Some of the underground structures serve as residential areas, some are hubs of the tunnel network
the drow use to travel throughout Wildemount, some are used for the farming of edible mushrooms, and some remain
true to their original purpose as holding cells for dangerous prisoners."

The city is sectioned as follows:

- Firmaments: luxurious city center and a place of higher learning
  - Lucid Bastion: in center of the city on a large hill, sits the Lucid Bastion
    - court of the three ruling "dens" of the Kryn Dynasty
    - home of Bright Queen Leylas Kryn and her husband, Dusk Captain Quana Kryn
  - Nimbus Keep: nearby is the Nimbus Keep, base of the Aurora Watch [entry to the Dungeon of Penance]
- Gallimaufry: mix of drow and Dwendalian Empire architecture; social center and commercial district, full of music
- Coronas: farmland, factories, industrial buildings, suburban residential
- Ghostland: beyond the walls.  incursions of the spirits of the calamity
[- Shadowspire: a grandiose, subterranean cavern underneath the city, accessed via the stairways in the Firmaments]


## Two Moons Square

"Hundreds of people flock to Two Moons Square in advance of the Brilliant Night, a Ruidius Apogee. The crowded plaza is named
 for the unique lighting, 3 particularly brilliant yellow arcane lanterns.  Currently is it alive, filled with
 colorful stalls and vendors hawking toys and keepsakes, Booths selling steaming rice and tangy mushroom stews.
 Moon-shaped desserts fill the air with delectable fragrances. 
 Throughout, visible members of the AW patrol, and scan the crowd for trouble."

- you can shop or ask around or both
- yes, you do eventually see the ornamental weapon stall, with two occupants
- after the verbal exchange, they motion you to the obscured rear area, ostensibly to look at pricier items at the back
 --> the  Golden Vault ask you to join them later at an house address in the Gallimaufry to talk.
     420-69 Gallifey Court.  in the meantime, feel free to enjoy the town, or, relax at Dim's Inn, not far from the house

- as they leave the square

"An ear-splitting crash pierces the air. Five figures wearing snarling, crimson masks clamber atop stalls, each
 raising a cone-like device to their mouth. Along with an irritating buzzing noise, the masked figures' voices
 emanate from the contraptions, amplified over the cacophony of the crowd: 
 'Down with the followers of the faceless god, an object with no soul.  no eyes, no ears, no mouth, ....
  the source of our current war and countless deaths in foreign realms.  These tyrants distract from the true
  god of the drow, the queen of the dark.  Come back to your mother!'

- The Ashen Heirs decry the AW as oppressive tyrants masquerading as saints
  [ GoldenVault / locals near you sigh; might be trouble -- Ashen Heirs]
- DC 16 Wisdom (Perception):
  - 5 AW head toward the instigators
  - intensifying vibration beneath your feet
- DC 14 Intelligence (Nature): something is burrowing under the square

"Stone cracks and people scream as a massive, spiked worm erupts from the center of the square, catapulting booths
 and handcarts into the air. The monstrosity roars, spraying the scattering crowd with fist-sized globs of spittle.
 Guards shout for reinforcements."
- The AH start to scatter
- 5 AW start to help locals escape

after a few rounds:
- DC 14 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) - Ashen Heirs' devices are irritating the creature
- DC 14 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) - drop their device (AC 13, hp 5)

after 5 rounds:
- Vaza (pari) appears + 10 AW (Nightguard)

aftermath: Vaza approaches
- A blue-skinned celestial with four scarlet wings lands before you, accompanied by a gentle breeze. 
  wears a pointed, shimmering helmet and wields a flanged mace. 
- if asked: "I am amazed by your work." "Sam, you have saved dozens of lives" "robot, and polymorpher -- you too"
  "I am Vaza, harbinger of the Nightguard and Xhorhas's righteous hand."
  "Do any of you need healing?"
  "Lead-ups to the Apogee spikes disruptions. Both Rebels and AW members are harmed during these altercations."
  "I'd really prefer those who oppose the BQ's rule to have the opportunity to learn the error of their ways... peaceably."
- offers a job for a few days -- 400gp each

  "The Queen worries for the safety of her people. Today's incident comes on the heels of an Ashen Heirs assault at
   other districts, which shows their threat is increasing. They're seeking powerful magics they know are hidden and that
   they can use to disrupt the Apogee. left unchecked, the queen will cancel the celebrations.. might even impose martial
   law until the rebels' threat is ended. Will you help us?"

- motions over to 2 AW questioning someone [Bonnie]
   Two AW question a calm medium-skinned half-drow half-elf woman with dark hair, sharp green eyes, and a pink tunic over a red dress. 
   One guard and the blue-skinned Vaza lock eyes, and the latter nods. The AW place manacles on the drow."
   he sighs -- "infamous agitator, that one.  worth questioning about her involvement in today's incident. she will be released.. if she's innocent."


## Safehouse

1) we were told to expect you but wee given limited information by Tybalt Rye
2) can you explain the situation
3) ok, here's what we got
   prison system: infiltrate the dungeon/pedestal --> read SP, to attempt access via shadowspire, "you'll need maps and intelligence"
   talk to the silent roar re: fellow prisoner. --> explain roar, visit the Ghor'ani Bakery or playhouse
   political route 1: deal w/ the ashen heir for Vasa.  --> explain ashen, Turmin's Tinctures and Tonics
   political route 2: shard solitaire

   pushes a map over, starts to describe the city
  - Gallimaufrey:
    - Dim's Inn: [Gaben, a well-groomed male dark elf with a pencil-thin white mustache, light yellow-orange eyes, 
                 and short white hair parted on one side and pulled over
    - Hammered Call: smithy [owned by Wursh, a half-orc
    - Turmin's Tinctures and Tonics: [duergar man Besh Turmin
    - Fadden's Gems: [older dark elf
  - Firmaments: Research on the building of war machines
    - Conservatory at Marble Tomes: [Professor Tuss Waccoh half-orc 
    - Whelsen's Rug Shop: black market business near the Two Moons square
  - the prisons: short term holding (he's not there), or the Shadowspire: Dungeon of Penance, or, the Pedestal of Judgement
  - route 2: there is an item, the shard solitaire, that the court is interested in,
     and a unique opportuniy has arisen around it.  the husband of the owner is second-guessing his wife's relatonship with it.
     we can get you an invite to a party at their fey mansion, where you can steal it.  
     and then you can use the shard solitare as a negotiating device, get a meeting to trade it for your man.

### Shadowspire

Under the city is the Shadowshire, a grandiose, subterranean cavern about a quarter mile across in every direction,
or greater when accounting for tributary caves.  
This area was reclaimed from Torog's prisons during the days of Ghor Dranas.
It accessed from the Firmaments by stairways spiraling around one of three pillars, tho, generally home only to the poor.
The base of the cavern is a bustling neighborhood of stone and glass, lit with green lantern light.
Luminescent crops line the floor and the ceiling of the central cavern, a massive underground farmland maintained
through magical means, bearing unique sunless vegetables.  walls contain protruding bits of rough rock, crystals,
and an exposed metal ore that glimmers when the light hits it.

Moreover, it contains an entrance to the Dungeon of Penance.

#### Dungeon of Penance

the Dungeon of Penance is an iron structure with a spiked, metallic railing. Burning braziers flank the large front
doors. Inside, a subtle dunamantic gravity distortion makes it difficult to trace one's path. The paths are lit
by perpetually crackling small, magically lit flames, and the prisoners are kept within small iron cages with
reinforced bars. There are at least four levels in the prison, with each level downward growing "progressively
darker and more heinous." The upper levels have been modified to reflect Kryn design, but many of the lower
levels are little changed from when Ghor Dranas was ruled by the Betrayer Gods. The temperature within the prison is
cold, and many guards and jailors supervise those locked within.

There are two known entrances: the base of the Shadowspire, and inside the Nimbus Keep.

### Pedestal of Judgement

The Pedestal of Judgment is a sixty-foot-diameter disc is made from black marble that floats two hundred feet above
the rocky ground, at the very tallest secton of the Shadowspire heights.  Gunmetal-banded green crystals hover near
the disc, like jeweled spikes adorning a crown. A handful of similar crystals orbit the disc, twinkling in the artifical skylight.

The pedestal is a holding and judgement area, courtroom, and visible symbol of that which is hidden below in the dungeon.

[13 Xhorhasian commoners are frozen within the gunmetal-banded, green crystals around the platform]
