Adam was born in the city of Zadash, a bustling metropolis in the heart of the Dwendalian
Empire on the continent of Wildemount. He grew up in a devout family of clerics and paladins,
who instilled in him a deep sense of faith and righteousness.

As a child, Adam was fascinated by the stories of heroes who fought against evil and protected
the innocent. He dreamed of becoming a champion of justice themselves, but his sheltered
upbringing meant he had little experience with the real world and its harsh realities.

This all changed when your Adam witnessed an act of injustice that shook his faith to its core.
He saw a group of corrupt officials abuse their power and oppress the people of a nearby
village, causing suffering and misery. The local authorities turned a blind eye, citing
political expediency and loyalty to the crown.

Feeling disillusioned and angry, Adam took it upon himself to investigate and expose the
corruption. He spent months gathering evidence, infiltrating secret meetings, and risking his
life in the process. Eventually, he uncovered a sinister plot to undermine the empire's
stability and increase the power of a rival faction.

In the ensuing confrontation, Adam fought with all his might, driven by a burning sense of
anger and determination. He emerged victorious, but not without suffering a grave injury that
left him scarred for life.

Despite the physical and emotional toll of their quest, Adam realized that they had found his
true calling. He dedicated themselves to the path of vengeance, determined to protect the
innocent and bring justice to those who would harm them.

Years later, Adam finds himself in Palma Flora, drawn to the annual tournament as a chance to
test his skills and perhaps find a new purpose in life.
