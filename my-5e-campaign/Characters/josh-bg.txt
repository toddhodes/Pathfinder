Fateful Moments
 ⦁ 6 - You were the sole survivor when a horde of rampaging monster raided your village or your
 neighborhood. You have proficiency in the Stealth skill or proficiency with martial weapons
 (your choice).

 ⦁ 10 - You were press-ganged into military service, and were left shaken by what you saw on
 the battlefield. You have proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons. You
 also have a random form of indefinite madness, determined by rolling on the Indefinite Madness
 table in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.
   ⦁ Indefinite Madness
     ⦁ 28 - "I try to become more like someone else I know—adopting his or her style of dress, mannerisms, and name."


raised in a neighborhood in Zadash that at some point got attacked by monsters.  I stood up to
them, which is why I'm considered a folk hero, but that resulted in everyone else getting
killed.  I actually consider my status as a "folk hero" more of a curse than a blessing, and
would rather not have people singing praises for what maybe I consider to be my biggest act of
foolishness and/or regret.  I was driven to be a Druid to get away from people to some extent.

I also haven't decided if the monster attack happened before or after I was press-ganged into
military service.  I was thinking before; maybe as a direct result of the monster attack I then
got conscripted to fight back against them.  Or maybe the "monsters" were actually Dwendalian
humans raiding my neighborhood (maybe a poor/nonhuman neighborhood, given Zadash is in the
Dwendalian Empire) and then I was forced to fight against the Kryn.  Or maybe the military
service doesn't have anything to do with the conflict between DE and KD.

So yeah, that's kinda where I'm at right now.  I guess the biggest area that I could use your
insight/suggestions on is the military service, particularly who may have forced me into it and
who I was fighting.  But also would like to hear if you think a monster attack in a
neighborhood of Zadash makes sense (if not, maybe that's where I grew up and then moved
somewhere else), and any thoughts on the Folk Hero angle.
