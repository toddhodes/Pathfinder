One character's relative killed Galsariad Ardyth's older brother in a family drama gone wrong. 

Another character suffers visons of a terrible future, and was raised by a wolf pack that the
Wastewalker clan harried/competed against. OR she was lost by the Wastewalker clan and the wolves
found her.

Another is a wood-elf, Circle of the Stars druid, whose family was killed during the Chroma
Conclave on Taldorei. He's been wandering for the past two decades watching the stars. (portents
with the Moon have led him to Xhorhas recently).
