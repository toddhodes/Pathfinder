The commander function in N7 is weird, the players nominate someone to be the commander and the
only function it has is if the other players move to far away, they take damage. I would add
something to it like giving them the ability to order troops or fire siege weapons

push your players into N15 to meet Theo (or introduce him somewhere else) as he provides a huge
amount of context and clarify for the party as to how to proceed with Alyxian in the final
encounter. Without meeting him, the party could be inclined to just release him and get the bad
ending and not really understand why that happened.

The Moon fight in N25 is weird, I think the moon has too many hit point and the combat isn't
really that engaging. My players really didn't have a clue they were in combat.
