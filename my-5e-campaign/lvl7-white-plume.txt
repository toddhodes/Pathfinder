7. Geysers and Chains

- give handout
- explain rope rules

ropes tied: need to choose STR + DEX or INT + WIS
saves will be made on fall/strain/geyser

jumping from circle to circle is DC8; 
if you take your time, it is w/ advantage. if you go fast, disadvantage.
on a miss, with a rope, roll 1d8; they fall off in that direction
if the rope was on the other side, they hang from target; if same side,
they either hang from previous or that comes off too

at the end of each round, roll d20; 1-6 geyser erupts

geyser: DC15 DEX for half
        DC10-14 STR to fall

Adjacent to geyser	        (5d10) damage	14
One disk away	            (4d10) damage	13
