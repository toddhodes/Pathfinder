ropes tied: need to choose STR + DEX or INT + WIS
saves will be made on fall/strain/geyser

jumping from circle to circle is DC10;
on a miss, with a rope, roll 1d8; they fall off in that direction
if the rope was on the other side, they hang from target; if same side,
they either hang from previous or that comes off too
