## Golden stags

travelling overland, party will think it sees a golden stag

golden stags are sensitve to the portal of the worlds, and maybe even a part of its workings.
when one is sighted, there is a chance there is a portal gate open in the vicinity, and,
moreover, the might be travellers nearby who have used it.


## Our story starts in the evening at a commonhouse

Warm candlelight, clean food smells, the clink of glassware
A Godmother corrals some kids in th corner
Heavier, war-weary men, veterans and farmhands, sit across the scattered tables

"gather around children, I'll tell you our favorite story, and then it's off to sleep."

this is the story of Vespin Chloras, the Calamity, and the Divergance

once upon a time, long before the Calamity, in the Age of Arcanum, the world
was perfect.  The benevolent Devine Prime Dieties ruled the lands, having
banished the Betrayer Gods from the Material Plane, held in extra-planar prisons.

But it was a time of stunningly powerful and magestic magic.  A city of Avalir floated
in the clouds above the city of Toramunda, in Vasselheim (the capital of human
civilization on the continent of Issylra.  The Dawn City, the Cradle of Faith, or the
Cradle of Creation. Theocratic with banned Arcane Magic.)

And the various races of man desired power, and were finding it.

A woman, in a story all its own, attained Godhood, replacing the God of Death itself, becoming
The Raven Queen.  She extended her life centuries in order to find the time to do so,
but, this wasn't particularly uncommon back then.  There were a lot of mages.  (This is
the Ritual of Seeding, also known as the Matron's Ritual or the Rite of Ascension, is a
powerful and forbidden working of magic by which a mortal can ascend to godhood. During
the Age of Arcanum, it was considered the pinnacle achievement of the arcane arts. Only
Venca also achieved it.)

But Godhood is something else entirely, and trifling with it
can cost not just the trier their life, even an attempt can completely change the world around it.

At the moment of her ascension, the name and knowledge of the previous God of Death was
sundered from reality and replaced by that of the Raven Queen, including in places of
worship across all of Exandria.  He? She? It? Maybe one of you can one day discover info
about this lost God and teach us all about it.


Others watched this development with great interest.  Replacing a Prime Diety felt harder than just Godhood.
A human named Vespin Chloras thought he could do it one better -- replace Asmodeous, taking out a Betrayer 
God in the process, and leaving all the exiting Prime Gods in place.  He thought he could make the world a better place.

But in doing so, he had to first free the Betrayer Gods from their prisons ... failing to become a God
and insteaed became the left hand of Asmodeus.

His failure led to the release of the Betrayer Gods from their extraplanar prisons, 
which caused the Calamity, a war that killed two-thirds of Exandria's population and left
permanent scars on its continents.  The city of Avalir fell from the clouds.  The teeth were shattered. 
(The Shattered Teeth is a major archipelago of 43 islands, located on Exandria
southeast of Tal'Dorei and far south of Wildemount, past the persistent
fogbank known as the Fool's Curtain )

Eventually, the Prime Deities and their allies finally defeated the Betrayer Gods,
and hoped to seal them away for good.  Thus came The Divergence -- the most
common name for the creation of the Divine Gate, a barrier that prevented the
gods from returning to the Material Plane and thereby diminished their
influence on Exandria. It marks the end of the Age of Arcanum.

Along the way were created great artifacts, and their legends.  Aong thes are
The Vestiges of Divergence: ancient and powerful artifacts from the Calamity. During the Age of
Arcanum, siphons were placed at nexuses of ley lines across Exandria to gather raw energy for
the crafting of powerful artifacts, including Vestiges.  Since the Calamity, these items have
been scattered around the world -â€” some lost, others symbols of power of bloodlines or
government, some stolen

One, a set of weapons: Blackrazor, Whelm, and Wave. 
1) life eater, 2) Dwarven crafting warhammer, 3) Sea-bonded trident
rumor has it they lay together underneath White Plume Mountain to this day, protected inside a
great wizard's magical home.  Tho he must be dead by now.  

And here we are now.  Be vigilant childrem, or the minions of Vespin Chloras will visit you,
clawing his way back from hell!

### Vestiges of Divergence

The Vestiges are legendary artifacts that grow in power with the bearer.  Vestiges start
reverted to their dormant state. A vestige in its dormant state still imbues power, but with
personal growth, the Vestige can reach its Awakened state. Eventually, through extreme
achievement, the Vestige can reach its full potential in its Exalted state.

Vestiges are more than fancy equipment.  They can take on unique connections to Prime Dieties or Betrayers.

### Milf

a kobold covered in undersized, home-spun gear approaches you, tentatively.  he smells of pets/dander.
- staff with a live scorpion secured to the tip, stinger end pointed out
- flail w/ a glass jar of hornets 
- wooden cage with live giant centipede, which seems oddly aware of you and listening in

"hi!  i'm milf -- you know, like milk, but more fuckable!"
claims he is 3/4 human, is actually not human at all
an "inventor"

points to one of the charis of alternative race, says they have much in common
asks if they have kobold ancestry
asks -- are you my uncle?  agrees they definitely are.
"do you know my brother, Spurt, also a inventor?  Spurt is doing important things!"

half crouches down to feign sitting, as there is no chair for him to join,
smiles a meek smile, sips something from a tin cup


### City Watch arrives

3 guards arrive:
slaps down a drawing looking suspiciously like random player
is charged with robbery leading to murder
ask if they want to come now or do we need to get more guards
ask if they are prepared to bring witnesses to whereabouts and character or if they need to retrieve them

- hard labor for 8 weeks
- 1000 GP fine, loan plus interest, 25% bond, 8 payments
