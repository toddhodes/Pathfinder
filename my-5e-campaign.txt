## Golden stags

travelling overland, party will think it sees a golden stag

golden stags are sensitve to the portal of the worlds, and maybe even a part of its workings.
when one is sighted, there is a chance there is a portal gate open in the vicinity, and,
moreover, the might be travellers nearby who have used it.


# Tavern history

garther around children, I'll tell you your favorite story 
the story of Vespin Chloras
but then it is time for bed.

once upon a time, long before the Calamity, in the Age of Arcanum, the world
was perfect.  The benevolent Devine Prime Dieties ruled the lands, having
banished the Betrayer Gods from the Material Plane, held in extra-planar prisons.

But it was a time of stunningly powerful and magestic magic.  A city of Avalir floated
in the clouds above the city of Toramunda, in Vasselheim (the capital of human
civilization on the continent of Issylra.  The Dawn City, the Cradle of Faith, or the
Cradle of Creation. Theocratic with banned Arcane Magic.)

And the various races of man desired power, and were finding it.

A woman, in a story all its own, attained Godhood, replacing the God of Death itself, becoming
The Raven Queen.  She extended her life centuries in order to find the time to do so,
but, this wasn't particularly uncommon back then.  There were a lot of mages.  (This is
the Ritual of Seeding, also known as the Matron's Ritual or the Rite of Ascension, is a
powerful and forbidden working of magic by which a mortal can ascend to godhood. During
the Age of Arcanum, it was considered the pinnacle achievement of the arcane arts. Only
Venca also achieved it.)

But Godhood is something else entirely, and trifling with it
can cost not just the trier their life, even an attempt can completely change the world around it.

At the moment of her ascension, the name and knowledge of the previous God of Death was
sundered from reality and replaced by that of the Raven Queen, including in places of
worship across all of Exandria.  He? She? It? Maybe one of you can one day discover info
about this lost God and teach us all about it.


Others watched this development with great interest.  Replacing a Prime Diety felt harder than just Godhood.
A human named Vespin Chloras thought he could do it one better -- replace Asmodeous, taking out a Betrayer 
God in the process, and leaving all the exiting Prime Gods in place.  He thought he could make the world a better place.

But in doing so, he had to first free the Betrayer Gods from their prisons ... failing to become a God
and insteaed became the left hand of Asmodeus.

Along the way were legends of 3 great weapons: Blackrazor, Whelm, and Wave, and rumor has it they lay together
underneath White Plume Mountain to this day, protected by a great wizard's magical home.  Tho he must be dead by now.

His failure led to the Calamity.  The city of Avalir fell from the clouds and 

The release of the Betrayer Gods from their extraplanar prisons caused the
Calamity, a war that killed two-thirds of Exandria's population and left
permanent scars on its continents.  The teeth used to be mountains!
(The Shattered Teeth is a major archipelago of 43 islands, located on Exandria
southeast of Tal'Dorei and far south of Wildemount, past the persistent
fogbank known as the Fool's Curtain )

When the Prime Deities and their allies finally defeated the Betrayer Gods,
they hoped to seal them away for good.  Thus came The Divergence -- the most
common name for the creation of the Divine Gate, a barrier that prevented the
gods from returning to the Material Plane and thereby diminished their
influence on Exandria. It marks the end of the Age of Arcanum.

And here we are now.  So, be good childrem, or Vespin Chloras will visit you
in your sleep. clawing his way back from hell!
